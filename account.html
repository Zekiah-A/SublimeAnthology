       <h2>Privacy &amp; Security:</h2>
       <p>While other things on this site may be, account security is no joke here, this site has no tracking, external cookies, etc, and never will, and the same principle goes for accounts, we will NEVER ever sell, share, or process ANYTHING related to personal information/accounts. Every non-public account detail is sha256 encrypted using your account code, with your account code being encrypted too! This means that it is impossible for us, or anyone else to ever acess any account detail without your account code, which can not be exfiltrated from our servers due to itself being encrypted, however, it also means that your account code is very important for security. If you think you have lost it, or someone else has gained access to it, please report here.</p>

If you post something publicly, people can see use it.</p>
       <h2>Being subliminal:</h2>
       <p>The final thing we'd like to note, is that this is a cool place. This site is supposed to be fun, experimental, a bit wacky, so feel free to join in with our community, commenting, annotating, rating, or submitting your own poems, no matter what you do here, if it is making subliminal a better place, we are all for it!</p>
