		<h2>Subliminal account agreement:</h2>
		<hr>
		<h2>Privacy &amp; Security:</h2>
		<p>While other things on this site may be, account security is no joke here, this site has no tracking, external
			cookies, etc, and never will, and the same principle goes for accounts, we will NEVER ever sell, share, or
			process ANYTHING related to private information/accounts. Every non-public account detail is sha256 encrypted
			using your account code, with your account code being encrypted too! This means that it is impossible for us,
			or anyone else to ever acess any account detail without your account code, which can not be exfiltrated from
			our servers due to itself being encrypted, however, it also means that your account code is very important for
			security. If you think you have lost it, or someone else has gained access to it, please report here.
		</p>
		<h2>Law and Regulations:</h2>
		<p>This site aims to be a place for freedom of expresion through the medium of poetry. While we can not claim
			responsibility for if you fall under punishment, penilisation, or persecution by an institution, government, or
			other individual as a result of a work submitted here, we will always try to protect you whenever we can. This
			means, never allowing your private info to be shared with anyone but you, ensuring that minimal information
			can be shared in the case of a sipoena, and allowing you to remove any data you have uploaded here on request.
		</p>
		<p>If you use this site, with the explicit purpose to publicly post illegal, or plain morally objectable content,
			your account may be removed, or IP blocked from submitting content to the site. It is both impossible, and
			against our values to use any of your private information against you, but, if you publicly post something
			such as your location, others can, and may forward this on to relevant authorities. Anything posted publicly
			can be used against you.
		</p>
		<h2>Being subliminal:</h2>
		<p>The final thing we'd like to note, is that this is a cool place. This site is supposed to be fun, experimental,
			a bit wacky, so feel free to join in with our community, commenting, annotating, rating, or submitting your own
			poems, no matter what you do here, if it is making subliminal a better place, we are all for it!
