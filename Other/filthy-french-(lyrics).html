        <b>Intro</b><br>
        <i>People of France,<br>
        I don't care if you're native, a tourist, or just visiting,<br>
        because this is personal.<br>
        Regardless of race, gender or age,<br>
        I'm gonna end this 100 year war in two minutes.</i><br>
        <br>
        <b>Chorus (1)</b><br>
        Walking through a town<br>
        Then my ears are blasted out<br>
        By this stupid french sound<br>
        'Cos I can't stand the language<br>
        Next thing you know,<br>
        I smelled a stench<br>
        First thing to mind,<br>
        Those filthy french<br>
        I can't even like food,<br>
        I resent<br>
        And I'm never visiting Paris again.<br>
        <b><br>
        Verse (1)</b><br>
        Walking through the streets, you see<br>
        Short girl, kinda racist, but also pretty,<br>
        Next thing you know, she came and spoke to me<br>
        in French<br>
        and I was like oh no (oh no),<br>
        <br>
        <b>Verse (2)</b><br>
        She was like, salut (salut), (au revoir),<br>
        I ain't hopping on that shit<br>
        like it's tour-de-France,<br>
        Then she grabbed my hand and tried to do a dance,<br>
        I popped a cap without a second glance...<br>
        <br>
        <b>Chorus (2)</b><br>
        Walking through a town<br>
        Then my ears are blasted out<br>
        By this retarded french sound<br>
        'Cos I can't stand the language<br>
        Next thing you know,<br>
        I smelled a stench<br>
        First thing to mind,<br>
        Those filthy french<br>
        I can't even like food,<br>
        I resent<br>
        Never ever visiting Paris again.<br>
        <br>
        (never visiting paris again)<sub>x4</sub><br>
        <b><br>
        Outro</b><br>
