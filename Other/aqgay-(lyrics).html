        <b>Intro</b><br>
        <i>I was cool with AQA,<br>
        I really was, you know,<br>
        giving out easy exam papers, practice papers,<br>
        you could do before the test,<br>
        However recently, and after seeing the advance information,<br>
        I am having quite a problem...</i><br>
        <br>
        <b>Chorus (1) </b><br>
        AQA is run by freaking pedos,<br>
        those child molesting people,<br>
        don't even publish pre-release before the test.<br>
        Juggling careers and getting kids stressed.<br>
        <sup>(x2)</sup><br>
        <br>
        <b>Verse (1)</b><br>
        Of all our pride and joy,<br>
        you are stealing ours<br>
        False advance information,<br>
        you're misleading us<br>
        You think you're slick,<br>
        putting us silently
        through hell<br>
        Make that soft paper hard,<br>
        and you pull an edexcel (now)<br>
        <br>
        <b>Verse (2)</b><br>
        AQA this ain't no attack.<br>
        I wish you the best.<br>
        But why did you only remove
        easy bits from the topic list?<br>
        And when they still pop up
        the students are pissed..<br>
        Taking a little responsibility,<br>
        ain't really a risk<br>
        <br>
        <b>Chorus (2)</b><br>

        AQA is run by freaking pedos,<br>
        those child molesting people,<br>
        don't even publish pre-release before the test.<br>
        Juggling careers and getting kids stressed.<br>
        <sup>(x2)</sup><br>
        <br>
        <b>Bridge (1)</b><br>
        They're asking for 9s
        but I'm dropping these 8s<br>
        Not enough lines for my
        six marker on gays<br>
        Evaluating Jane in my English essays<br>
        is she a strong?<br>
        Man just fuck this debate!<br>
        <br>
        Waffling now,<br>
        man I can just go on and on<br>
        Stupid ass answers it's a natural phenomenon<br>
        Exam board not human,
        they are decepticons<br>
        In the hall I'm trying to stay strong<br>
        <br>
        <b>Chorus (3)</b><br>
        AQA is run by freaking pedos, <font color="#9a9996">(auuuugh)</font><br>
        those child molesting people, <font color="#808080">(coughing)</font><br>
        don't even publish pre-release before the test.<br>
        Juggling careers and getting kids stressed.<br>
        <br>
