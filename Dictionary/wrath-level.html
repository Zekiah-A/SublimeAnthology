        <h3> Wrath (level) <em>(noun) - </em> </h3>
        <p> Inspired by the poem 'A Poison Tree', by William Blake is a 10-point ranking system used to express someone's anger. Someone claiming that they have a 'wrath level of one' may only be slightly annoyed, while someone with a wrath level of 10 may be aggravated to the point of inciting violence. </p>
