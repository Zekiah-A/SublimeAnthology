        <h3> Bamitz <em>(verb, noun) - </em> </h3>
        <p> A fictitious word referring to a curse / omen of bad luck, in order to issue retribution for a wrongdoing. A bamitz is often used to display a mildly negative event, such as losing your pencil case, after filling someone's water bottle with fountain pen ink, and a bamitz issued by someone onto another is only of the same intensity as their original action, however punishments from a being such as the <a href="../Dictionary/sublime"> Sublime</a> can be much worse. </p>

        <h3> Goodmitz <em>(verb, noun) - </em> </h3>
        <p> A fictitious word, often used in place of a phrase such as "I wish you well" to somebody else, it can be used as a verb, and directed towards anyone. </p>
