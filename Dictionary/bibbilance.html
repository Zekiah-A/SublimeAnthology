        <h3> Bibbilance <em>(noun) - </em> </h3>
        <p> A fictitious word referring to a curse / omen of bad luck, in order to issue retribution for a wrongdoing. A bamitz is often used to display a mildly negative event, such as losing your pencil case, after filling someone's water bottle with fountain pen ink, and a bamitz issued by someone onto another is only of the same intensity as their original action, however punishments from a being such as the <a href="../Dictionary/sublime.html"> Sublime</a> can be much worse. </p>
