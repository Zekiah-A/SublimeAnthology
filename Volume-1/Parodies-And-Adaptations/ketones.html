        Ketones, they’re everywhere, <br>
        They paint your walls and clean your nails. <br>
        But ketones in the blood are what could alter things. <br>
        <br>
        Arteries clogged from stress and ageing, <br>
        The kind you get from work and tests, <br>
        Bubbling in your head, <br>
        Where a hand types in Classcharts and SIMS, <br>
        The time, duration, seat and sanction, <br>
        Transparent with attention. <br>
        <br>
        If the brain had ketones I might feel its relief, <br>
        See my vision transform from standard definition, <br>
        To the most premium ever screen. <br>
        Muscles too, ketones penetrate their fibres, <br>
        And charge them with ATP. <br>
        <br>
        Fine strips from glucose tests that count the carbs we ate, <br>
        And force us to battle our bittersweet cravings, <br>
        That fly our lives like illegal drugs. <br>
        <br>
        Anyone could use ketones, of any size and shape, <br>
        And never wish to crave again or snap it at their friend. <br>
        <br>
        So let your liver, its ketones to build, <br>
        For the brain with them to feed, <br>
        Through arteries, capillaries and veins; evolution’s mastery, <br>
        And trace yourself a brand-new brain. <br>
        <br>
        With living ketones, raise new brain cells, <br>
        That will never die, <br>
        From a liver congested, once smoothed and scarred, <br>
        Fated otherwise to sleep, <br>
        But PERMANENTLY. <br>
        <br>
        Ketones – they can’t be stored as fat or glycogen; <br>
        Used up right away. <br>
        But embark into a one way journey <br>
        From your adipose cells, <br>
        And exit through your urine. <br>
