It was an act of wits \u0001and unpaid tickets. Hidden behind the daily mail \u0001And bottles of booze, Ticket inspector \u0001left, flowing. \u0001Leaving behind my borrowed flat, sunlight mist \u0001danced through the sewers. Rats spinning idly in the window. \u0001Until they succame, to the wheels \u0001while on the track. Harmoniously blending \u0001into a sweet red syrup. \u0001But now, gliding down the rails, \u0001sitting ephiphanantically, I looked out. \u0001Peering through the canned colours on the glass, I saw \u0001Two terrific towers, thrown forward, \u0001arching and bending they mocked. A second sun, \u0001bursting through the colossal peaks. A falling horizon, \u0001of heat and twisted wire. \u0001Their visages turned blood, they lunged. I fled \u0001and fought, they hurled debris \u0001as shards of sand sliced through skin, I reeled \u0001and broke free and fell to the comfort \u0001of rock and railroad dust. My groggy home. \u0001","pageStyle":"poem-centre-wide","pageBackground":""}
