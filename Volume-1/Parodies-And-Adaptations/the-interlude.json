It was an act of wits <br>\nand unpaid tickets. Hidden behind the daily mail <br>\nAnd bottles of booze, Ticket inspector <br>\nleft, flowing. <br>\nLeaving behind my borrowed flat, sunlight mist <br>\ndanced through the sewers. Rats spinning idly in the window. <br>\nUntil they succame, to the wheels <br>\nwhile on the track. Harmoniously blending <br>\ninto a sweet red syrup. <br>\nBut now, gliding down the rails, <br>\nsitting ephiphanantically, I looked out. <br>\nPeering through the canned colours on the glass, I saw <br>\nTwo terrific towers, thrown forward, <br>\narching and bending they mocked. A second sun, <br>\nbursting through the colossal peaks. A falling horizon, <br>\nof heat and twisted wire. <br>\nTheir visages turned blood, they lunged. I fled <br>\nand fought, they hurled debris <br>\nas shards of sand sliced through skin, I reeled <br>\nand broke free and fell to the comfort <br>\nof rock and railroad dust. My groggy home. <br>","pageStyle":"poem-centre-wide","pageBackground":""}
