    <p>
        One spring lunchtime (led by her),<br>
        They found a shiny basketball, frozen on the road,<br>
        Between the grand fields, it's usual home.<br>
        <br>
        The wizened earth has never troubled us;<br>
        No lions chase, or hidden snakes to miss,<br>
        Or teachers to comfort them, when the youngsters take the piss;<br>
        Two trunk-less goalposts, and a few dotted trees just stand.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        But this basketball was no ordinary one.<br>
        Small gemstones glittered between it's plastic skin,<br>
        Melting in that girl's eyes.<br>
        <br>
        She was an A* student and wondered as she wandered<br>
        How a sphere can stand still, on the slope of a hill.<br>
        Proud of her skill, she knew she could find it,<br>
        Those beams of light were nothing but photons.<br>
        <br>
        A God given gift; perhaps a Trojan horse?<br>
        This was magic, but it couldn't; be vane.<br>
        She crouched right down above this mystical object,<br>
        And checked her under-eye under he mirror,<br>
        But she was sane.<br>
        <br>
        As she rose from that stroke of shock,<br>
        She raises her foot right up,<br>
        straight into a perfect right angle to her upright stance,<br>
        And as if with voluntary human instinct,<br>
        Booted the magic ball; <i>turned savage</i>.<br>
        <br>
        Still in the stature of her shape, grew the dunnest stinging pain.<br>
        The very basketball, spat out it's grey contents.<br>
        They were bombarded by a hollow ball.<br>
        <br>
        They huffed and puffed again,<br>
        For so it seemed, with struggle of her own,<br>
        Measuring motion like a living thing,<br>
        To haul a crappy plastic ball in the bin!<br>
        <br>
        Back to the covert of sixth-<sup></sup>form centre,<br>
        There hung a darkness, call it solitude.<br>
        No familiar shapes remained;<br>
        No pleasant images of trees or green fields;<br>
        Four year 11s running away giggling,<br>
        Day by day, a plague to her dreams.<br>
        <br>
