    <p>
        We know nothing, we build our saunas broad. <br>
        Broad and tall, just like the reptillians that roam the earth, <br>
        and the white froths that beat at our lagoons. <br>
        <br>
        Huawei has never threatened us, <br>
        yet we know that they lie beneath, <br>
        in colossal chrome canisters of crap; a natural home - <br>
        <br>
        Ready to summon a storm, of sedimentary sewage and <br>
        dead fish bones. <br>
        <br>
        Produced by us. <br>
        <br>
        Carbon particulates rain down on the grilli, simmering, <br>
        smoking, and burning through the sausages. <br>
        Rain turns yellow as each sceptic tank blows full, <br>
        reducing the iso to a mound of crap and flies. <br>
        <br>
        Yet, <br>
        it is a giant seagull which we still fear? <br>
