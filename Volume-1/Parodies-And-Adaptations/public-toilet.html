    <p>
        Of all the public places, dear,<br>
        to chose to piss, I've chosen here,<br>
        on your doorstep, under the stars,<br>
        or behind the doors of parked-up cars,<br>
        No, your doorstep truly rules,<br>
        as the perfect toilet stool.<br>
        <br>
        For number 1, I can chose the foot of your door,<br>
        For number 2, go inside, and on your floor,<br>
        For number 3, I'll climb up your chimney, and pee<br>
        all over your carpets.<br>
        <br>
        I bought lemonade with your kind coppers,<br>
        that was big of you.<br>
        The soles of your shoes are wet now,<br>
        that's piss for you.<br>
        <br>
