        <!-- Change to doube grid style for poems like this-->
        It burns into the mind, <br>
        A simple line of black. <br> <!-- Underline this whole line -->
        Torn at the edges, the <br>
        simple paper is a <br>
        prison to my mind. <br> <!-- Blood effect here on 'prison'. --> 
        <br>
        Cruel words spoken, <br>
        A dark abyss of <br>
        Fractured linearity <br>
        The black splodges can, <br>
        Only lead to one place.
    </p>
    <p style="color: darkblue;">
        Then to blue <br>
        Clumped bunches <br>
        of agonies, azure <br>
        Stained in an ocean, <br>
        Battering the paper, <br>
        <br>
        Navy line of weathered <br>
        Wars takes it's toll. <br>
        <br>
        Dramatically Cuts of paper, <br>
        Shattered reveal the, <br>
        Former Visage : Hidden <br>
        In blood.
    </p>
    <p style="color: darkred;">
        Ink, it's like Blood isn't it. <br> <!-- Blood effects here on full stop -->
        Frantically pumped out of <br>
        The pen nib. Or my veins. <br>
        <br>
        The paper is a beautiful picture <br>
        of Scarlet. <br> <!-- Blood effects here on 'Scarlet' -->
        The cut paper morphs into <br>
        Skin. <br>
        All flesh is paper. <br>
        The tales of death cut into <br>
        <span style="font-size: large;">Skin</span> <br> <!-- and folded into bone. -->
        <br>
        I write onto the paper <br>
        And arteries burst. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        To take a life. <br>
