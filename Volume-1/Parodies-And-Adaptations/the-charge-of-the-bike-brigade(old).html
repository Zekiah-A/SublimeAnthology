        Mud and snow and hail and ice,<br>
        Not another Late twice,<br>
        Charge to OzyAndy Gate,<br>
        Attached is twenty miles an hour.<br>
        <br>
        Can you see a yellow line?<br>
        Green to amber went the light?<br>
        Punch a hole against the air <br>
        And hit thirty miles an hour. <br>
        <br>
        Let it splatter, let it batter,<br>
        Let them run and coil in covers,<br>
        Surf your way through the brown lake,<br>
        At forty miles an hour.<br>
        <br>
        A pool of mud to rip straight through,<br>
        Drown the bus stop to the roof,<br>
        Remember the one way to Ozygate<br>
        At fifty miles an hour.<br>
        <br>
        Swerving through the Nissan Qashqais,<br>
        Under the brutal, thund’ring skies,<br>
        You made it – OzyAndy's Gate!<br>
        At sixty miles an hour.<br>
        <br>
        When your King counts down from ten,<br>
        ‘‘Lack of homework – bad gears!’’- he said,<br>
        Just dash yourself through plants and pots,<br>
        Free yourself of these mind-forg'd locks<br>
        At seventy miles an hour!<br>
        <br>
        You have the speed, take off high!<br>
        Over the Butler and the Wry,<br>
        Sorry, I landed on the Castle’s lock,<br>
        At eighty miles an hour.<br>
        <br>
        Shirt caught on sparks and tyre marks,<br>
        Screams: ‘‘On Saturday clear that muck!<br>
        Now get to form shirtless, and mourn<br>
        ’’

        Your wheel’s remains along this floor…<br>
        <br>
        At 0 miles an hour
        <br>
