    <p>
        That's my first among us game printed on the leader-board, <br>
        I was imposter that round I recall, <br>
        I do remember how I won the game, <br>
        Credits to my sheer intelligence and perfect play, <br>
        ruined by some simple-minded folk, <br>
        Have you encountered such idiocy sir? I provoke, <br>
        I remember him telling the crew to vote, <br>
        for me, green, he didn't even see me vent, <br>
        this man didn't play on logic, just a stupid guess. <br>
        "Green sus guys, he just is, K", <br>
        And I now wonder, what must've been running through his brain? <br>
        Abiding no among-us rules, <br>
        Tips the scales of the crew, <br>
        A paragraph, a flurry of arguments, evidence and lore of the game, <br>
        toppled by the sorry retort "lol, K", <br>
        "He's still sus though, Idk why", <br>
        <em>Green was the imposter,</em> <br>
        and then I died. <br>
        <br>
