        Another midsummer midday, I ventured, <br>
        out into the calm hubub of the Capital. <br>
        The roaring skyscrapers, crashing, silent in the soft, dark smog. <br>
        Light peeling through the carbon particulates, and stepping in <br>
        The train embarked. It was an act of wits <br>
        and unpaid tickets. Hidden behind the daily mail <br>
        And bottles of booze, Ticket inspector <br>
        left, flowing. <br>
        Leaving behind my borrowed flat, sunlight mist <br>
        danced through the sewers. Rats spinning idly in the window. <br>
        Until they succame, to the wheels <br>
        while on the track. Harmoniously blending <br>
        into a sweet red syrup. <br>
        But now, gliding down the rails, <br>
        sitting ephiphanantically, I looked out. <br>
        Peering through the canned colours on the glass, I saw <br>
        Two terrific towers, thrown forward, <br>
        arching and bending they mocked. A second sun, <br>
        bursting through the colossal peaks. A falling horizon, <br>
        of heat and twisted wire. <br>
        Their visages turned blood, they lunged. I fled <br>
        and fought, they hurled debris <br>
        as shards of sand sliced through skin, I reeled <br>
        and broke free and fell to the comfort <br>
        of rock and railroad dust. My groggy home. <br>
