    <p>
        Curled up into a circle, <br>
        a quick, slick momentary trick, <br>
        probably followed by a hit or flick <br>
        Yet above the waist, <br>
        a grave twisting of God’s rules <br>
        Objection! <br>
        Last mistake; the Sublime appals. <br>
        <br>
        Summoned up to the bright void of darkness, <br>
        like some kind of sun stunned wasteland, <br>
        a senate curs’d judgement day. <br>
        Pleas to be released of your unattoned sins, <br>
        your only escape, and <br>
        for the jury it’s a mockery, a game <br>
        <br>
        There’s a chance of survival, yet it’s thin <br>
        thinned like the eyes of the victim when you performed your trick <br>
        How you wish it were penetrated, or <br>
        Just a few centimetres more below the hip <br>
        <br>
        Fate lies near to the knuckle, here and now, <br>
        or maybe slightly inbetween, <br>
        Begging for some invisible-damned sicko’s reprimand,<br>
        A reality that could only be orchestrated within Axel’s dream. <br>
