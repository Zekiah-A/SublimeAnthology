Oh hell no! <br>\nCondense it down, into a brick <br>\nThen burn it over some snail piss! <br>\n<br>\nLet the snail crawl, it's on the run, <br>\nThen mow it down with my machine gun! <br>\nGet the ashes, that remain, <br>\nand stomp them into the ground again! <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nMy foot is now contaminated, <br>\nyou and i are now related. <br>\nExcept not really, that's a joke, <br>\nCut it off, dip it in egg yolk. <br>\n<br>\nBut now i can no longer stomp, <br>\nrevenge tastes nice though, <br>\nchomp chomp chomp. <br>\n",
