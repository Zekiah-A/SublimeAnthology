    <h2 class="centre content"> Happy Old Man - By Hanash </h2>
    <hr>
    <div class="poem-centre">
    <p>
        Green of the sea <br>
        To greed of the grass <br>
        The happy man smiled <br>
        <br>
        Until it wasn't, he smiled though sad <br>
        Bleeding thro' red tears <br>
        Papier du soleil <br>
        Angst von die Zukunft <br>
        Called the grass, as it bled <br>
        Blood fell onto the sea <br>
        Washing it yellow <br>
        <br>
        Emporious shell to speak wasn't but it was <br>
        The tale of the sad old man be a tale of woe <br>
        From happy to sad <br>
        Where does he go? <br>
        <br>
