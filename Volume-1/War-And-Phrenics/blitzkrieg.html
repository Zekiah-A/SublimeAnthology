        Missiles falling, and killing the sinners<br>
        Ukraine, Ukraine, sore losers,<br>
        Mother Russia, die Mutterland, winners.<br>
        <b><em>"Unleash the EDP into society"</em></b> <br>
        break them out of jail,<br>
        Then look up into the sky, put up one<br>
        hand STRAIGHT up into the air,<br>
        and expect the nukes to hail<br>
        <br>
        Hail 'OzyAndy, our fr√ºher, our Lord,<br>
        pray for his detentions, and then sit there, Bored.<br>
        Detention in class for bringing in tic tacks,<br>
        Shoot this guy because he's black,<br>
        blast the sky, 'till it's brown, full crap,<br>
        Get an AK and bring it into die Stadtmitte, Snap,<br>
        in the school and mow them<br>
        Down.<br>
        <br>
        Then remember as their lives lie in your bloody hands,<br>
        This was the war,<br>
        and it all went to plan.<br>
        <br>
        Then remember as their lives lie in your bloody hands to this day.<br>
