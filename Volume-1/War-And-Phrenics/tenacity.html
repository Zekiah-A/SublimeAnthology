    <p>
        For the first day my eyes bisected every inch of your <br>
        personage, I gave you my energy, my all, my heart <br>
        my blood, my toil, my gall. Yet, it never returned, no, your <br>
        etheral glow, shut out by a blizzard of snow, <br>
        my body dropping, as my mind freezes, my fingers numbing <br>
        an epiphany. <br>
        <br>
        I pull AKs; now you run, <br>
        bullets ripping through you, love, <br>
        you didn't give me shit, <br>
        It's no mistake. <br>
        <br>
        Two weeks later, <br>
        I spit, <br>
        on yor grave. <br>
