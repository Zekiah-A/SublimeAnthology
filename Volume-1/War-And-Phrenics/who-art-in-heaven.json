A small lone seagull screeched in a heavenly fury.<br>\nAs it smashed the brains out of a colossal giant.<br>\nBlood spilling like wine, for each holy creature.<br>\n<br>\nAfter the reckoning, light starts to pierce through<br>\ntheir shroud of feather, casting silver beams<br>\non the redder concrete, as strange forms of<br>\nflesh lay dismembered<br>\nbelow.<br>\n<br>\nLike doves they disappeared<br>\ninto this light.<br>\n<br>\nFair retributions for our sins,<br>\nwe had forgotten to feed the seagulls.<br>\nBut we don't know that they will return again,<br>\ntomorrow.<br>\n<br>\n    ",
