A small lone seagull screeched in a heavenly fury.\u0001As it smashed the brains out of a colossal giant.\u0001Blood spilling like wine, for each holy creature.\u0001\u0001After the reckoning, light starts to pierce through\u0001their shroud of feather, casting silver beams\u0001on the redder concrete, as strange forms of\u0001flesh lay dismembered\u0001below.\u0001\u0001Like doves they disappeared\u0001into this light.\u0001\u0001Fair retributions for our sins,\u0001we had forgotten to feed the seagulls.\u0001But we don't know that they will return again,\u0001tomorrow.\u0001\u0001    ","pageStyle":"poem-centre-wide","pageBackground":""}
