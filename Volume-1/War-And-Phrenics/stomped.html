        Wrath level 1. <br>
        It all began with an itch. <br>
        A dead flicker. An oddball glitch, <br>
        It’s like Stain is in my brain, <br>
        A half twitch of insanity appalls, <br>
        Axeli’s name scratched onto the walls - <br>
        No. I ignore. <br>
        I told my wrath, my wrath did end. <br>
        <br>
        Wrath level 2. <br>
        Then I see a Lokki, <br>
        A white lossenge, amongst its kin, <br>
        Like some dull, retarded housemartin has-been. <br>
        But I blink <br>
        And into a visage of fury I wander - <br>
        I see its beak-snapp’d, blood-jack’d, half smack’d body, <br>
        And its wings stapled into some shoddy, floppy mockery. <br>
        And as a withered, stompable peabody <br>
        It drops dead onto the ground. And I swear- <br>
        As my foot hovers over his carcass, I’m enveloped in this darkness- <br>
        Voices of rocks, voices of Aiti, that yell with harshness <br>
        and sharpness that tarnish my catharsis <br>
        Regardless. I was angry with my foe, <br>
        I told it not. My wrath did grow - <br>
        <br>
        And now it breeded to Wrath level 7, <br>
        I see this light coming from heaven. It’s bright, <br>
        A familiar sight, it's almost… <br>
        Sublime. A king of kings, <br>
        Supreme ruler of the coolest things, <br>
        He warned me to end. End the wrath. <br>
        <br>
        But no. It grew both day and night, <br>
        Till it bore an apple bright. <br>
        And the Sublime beheld it shine <br>
        <br>
        For he knew that it was mine- <br>
        Wrath level 10, And the twitch commenced again. A dead flicker, <br>
        An oddball glitch, it’s like <br>
        I’m in a battle with Axel and <br>
        Now everything screams, <br>
        A siren of the Phrenes, I scream and scream <br>
        And all the more my foot twitches, which is <br>
        A sign that the stomp is MINE! <br>
        MINE, not the Sublime’s, or <br>
        some other klein spineless swine in brine’s, <br>
        I see the blood stained hue, remains of the lokki’s life <br>
        Settle within its eyes. Free of remorse, I laugh. <br>
        I laugh, and then <br>
        I stomp. <br>
        <br>
        Blood. Blood everywhere. <br>
        Stomp. It’s a crippled bloodbath of wing and beak, <br>
        I stomp. It is dead. I laugh. <br>
        Stomp. It’s a joke, it’s all a joke! <br>
        I stomp. A killing joke. <br>
        <br>
        I stomp. <br>
        <br>
        And now I won’t ever stop. <br>
