An oddball glitch, <br>\nIt’s like Stain is in my brain, <br>\nA half twitch of insanity appalls, <br>\nAxeli’s name scratched onto the walls - <br>\nNo. I ignore. <br>\nI told my wrath, my wrath did end. <br>\n<br>\nWrath level 2. <br>\nThen I see a Lokki, <br>\nA white lossenge, amongst its kin, <br>\nLike some dull, retarded housemartin has-been. <br>\nBut I blink <br>\nAnd into a visage of fury I wander - <br>\nI see its beak-snapp’d, blood-jack’d, half smack’d body, <br>\nAnd its wings stapled into some shoddy, floppy mockery. <br>\nAnd as a withered, stompable peabody <br>\nIt drops dead onto the ground. And I swear- <br>\nAs my foot hovers over his carcass, I’m enveloped in this darkness- <br>\nVoices of rocks, voices of Aiti, that yell with harshness <br>\nand sharpness that tarnish my catharsis <br>\nRegardless. I was angry with my foe, <br>\nI told it not. My wrath did grow - <br>\n<br>\nAnd now it breeded to Wrath level 7, <br>\nI see this light coming from heaven. It’s bright, <br>\nA familiar sight, it's almost… <br>\nSublime. A king of kings, <br>\nSupreme ruler of the coolest things, <br>\nHe warned me to end. End the wrath. <br>\n<br>\nBut no. It grew both day and night, <br>\nTill it bore an apple bright. <br>\nAnd the Sublime beheld it shine <br>\n<br>\nFor he knew that it was mine- <br>\nWrath level 10, And the twitch commenced again. A dead flicker, <br>\nAn oddball glitch, it’s like <br>\nI’m in a battle with Axel and <br>\nNow everything screams, <br>\nA siren of the Phrenes, I scream and scream <br>\nAnd all the more my foot twitches, which is <br>\nA sign that the stomp is MINE! <br>\nMINE, not the Sublime’s, or <br>\nsome other klein spineless swine in brine’s, <br>\nI see the blood stained hue, remains of the lokki’s life <br>\nSettle within its eyes. Free of remorse, I laugh. <br>\nI laugh, and then <br>\nI stomp. <br>\n<br>\nBlood. Blood everywhere. <br>\nStomp. It’s a crippled bloodbath of wing and beak, <br>\nI stomp. It is dead. I laugh. <br>\nStomp. It’s a joke, it’s all a joke! <br>\nI stomp. A killing joke. <br>\n<br>\nI stomp. <br>\n<br>\nAnd now I won’t ever stop. <br>\n",
