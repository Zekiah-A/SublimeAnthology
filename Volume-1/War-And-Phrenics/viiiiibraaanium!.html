    <p>
      Deep in the mines, behind locked doors. <br>
      Lay 2.3 kilos of vibranium ore. <br>
      ShaaAky and CRAzy, a SOurCE of UttER RaNDom, <br>
      Rare, and purple, turned gold azure. <br>
      <br>
      A lure, a deadly flaw, <br>
      a dangerous force, it watches and <br>
      screams like your food and your <br>
      drink when you drive to the brink <br>
      hypnotic crystals turned gore. <br>
      <br>
      And BAM, it flies up, <br>
      purple veins through your head, <br>
      now you're dead, and trust me, <br>
      it's the best you could get, <br>
      as staring too long into those voidless, <br>
      pearl eyes, <br>
      can reveal all your fears, bring a <br>
      rage to a cry. <br>
      <br>
      And I, <br>
      declare war on vibranium ore, <br>
      that scum runs the drum, <br>
      on this trickster, this 'ore. <br>
      I deplore! <br>
      <br>
      And abhore, <br>
      It pulls my last straw, <br>
      Then CRACKS, BENDS and SMASHES it, <br>
      so I'll open that door! <br>
      <br>
      and I, will eradicate it until there no longer is any more. <br>
      <br>
