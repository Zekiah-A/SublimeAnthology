    <p>
        About 132 fluorescent lights, <br>
        at full blast at 12, at dusk. <br>
        Green plastic floors, colossal breeze-block walls <br>
        <br>
        Yet shoddy protection from the heat at the peak of the night, <br>
        where the children scream, and the industrial fans take flight. <br>
        The hapless cry of each dying phone; <br>
        man I wish I could go home. <br>
        <br>
        Because almost as far as my eye can't see, it's <br>
        a coin flip chance if the body in the beanbag <br>
        is awake or asleep, on the hard gymnasium floor, <br>
        Are we luxuries in a warehouse, or humans, I <br>
        must emplore.. <br>
        <br>
        This is worse than Squid Games, yet I can't <br>
        complain. <br>
        <br>
        A ceiling of steel, with five-house-wide metal <br>
        beams. <br>
        <br>
        School walls too clean for comfort, it's a <br>
        shame... <br>
        <br>
        My identity, stripped; 113B. <br>
        <br>

        part of the southern 50)</sub> <br>
