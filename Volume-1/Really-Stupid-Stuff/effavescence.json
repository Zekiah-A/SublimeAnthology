From these waves, \u0001the rate they vibrate, \u0001is faster than any machine, that you could try make. \u0001No debate. \u0001\u0001I don't rate all of this dissipated noise. \u0001From idiots, schizos, so settle down, boys, \u0001and enjoy the sounds, coming straight from my mouth. \u0001Recordings of truths sound different out loud. \u0001\u0001Life-giving medium, air, is what sound travels through. \u0001Sound estranged to silence, in deep space's vacuum. \u0001\u0001","pageStyle":"poem-centre-wide","pageBackground":""}
