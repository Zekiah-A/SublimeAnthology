From these waves, <br>\nthe rate they vibrate, <br>\nis faster than any machine, that you could try make. <br>\nNo debate. <br>\n<br>\nI don't rate all of this dissipated noise. <br>\nFrom idiots, schizos, so settle down, boys, <br>\nand enjoy the sounds, coming straight from my mouth. <br>\nRecordings of truths sound different out loud. <br>\n<br>\nLife-giving medium, air, is what sound travels through. <br>\nSound estranged to silence, in deep space's vacuum. <br>\n<br>","pageStyle":"poem-centre-wide","pageBackground":""}
