        It ushered itself into the dark blue blade <br>
        The embodiment of thought, an azure metal <br>
        Sometimes red, of quick malice in the swift cut <br>
        Othertimes not, a dark sky that speaks not of vengeance <br>
        But what. Sometimes it yearns for blood, conflict, <br>
        Othertimes honour. <br>
        Contained in that sword, that fragment of metal, <br>
        Yet freer than the icy bonds it be held within. <br>
