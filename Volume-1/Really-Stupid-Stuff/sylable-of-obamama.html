    In a land of a river <br>
    was a weir  the <br>
    river was not on the land, but <br>
    the land was the river. <br>

    Run for green <br>
    Run from Obama, <br>
    for he is coming, <br>
    coming for your blood, <br>
    drink the grass, <br>
    consume the <code style="font-size: x-large;">G L U E</code>, <br>
    Obama is coming, <br>
    Coming for you <br>
    <br>
    Arrowed spines of mind- <br>
    forg'd mannacles penetrate <br>
    the brighten'd lunch, <br>
    a feast of minds <br>
    The fear'd beast we celebrate. <br>

    Vortex of river <br>
    Obama is here <br>
    retch out blood, <br>
    hands encrusted in urea <br>
    Blood, new dawn <br>
    <br>
    <em>Obama</em> <br>
    <em>Obama</em> <br>
    <br>
    The veinous tree <br>
    shrinks in the putri'd <br>
    dawn, but night <br>
    fear the dawn, <br>
    fear the dark <br>
    await for fury's yawn <br>
    <br>
    Obama is here <br>
    how fruitious was death <br>
    furtive g<sup>l</sup>ance. <br>
    Bas Blick, und es war <br>
    Uusikaupunki <br>
    enhanced. <br>
