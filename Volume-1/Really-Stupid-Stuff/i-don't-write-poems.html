    <hr>
    <div class="poem-centre">
    <p>
        Ruffling in the bushes is a creature <br>
        A creature baffling, bad and anger <br>
        Anger leaving the face of The earth <br>
        Earth a desolate planet of death <br>
        Death and more death spreading like <br>
        <br>
        Like butter on bread, wholemeal bread <br>
        Bread not white, but brown and full <br>
        Full of fibre and colour not <br>
        Not false, false, false information <br>
        Information dense and decrepid, yet young <br>
        Young, as young as an old man <br>
        <br>
        Man, I wish I could taste it <br>
        It tastes like acid, feels like sunlight <br>
        Sunlight shining into the brain of a stain <br>
        Stains projected off the weed of a killer <br>
        Killer auxins spread out on the shady side <br>
        Side with me if you want to live in this world <br>
        <br>
        Worlds collide in the swirling infinite <br>
        Infinite, calisthetic, MEAT, alpha lives on <br>
        On as I turn on my Mac and leave <br>
        Leaving it open on my desk, forever alone <br>
        Alone like Axeli. <br>
        <br>
