    <p>
        Mr Fisher, sat down in the chair,<br>
        as he scrolled through each student's work,<br>
        Matthew, Mark, Jacob, John,<br>
        then as his eyes fell onto one, he starts to smirk.<br>
        Back arched, body lurched,<br>
        over the desks, he started sweating.<br>
        Herr Fisher's favourite student, and as<br>
        he read it, he started undressing.<br>
        <br>
        They clearly did this on the bus,<br>
        you can see the text getting larger,<br>
        It doesn't matter for Herr Fisher though,<br>
        as each paragraph is getting harder,<br>
        to read.<br>
        <br>
        Screech. A loud sound from the back of<br>
        the class.<br>
        The FBI, Police and army marched,<br>
        right into the room,<br>
        and started to arrest,<br>
        this crazy old man,<br>
        completely undressed,<br>
        <br>
        Mr Fisher the pedo,<br>
        Mr Fisher the creep,<br>
        don't worry, he'll be back in school again,<br>
        next week.<br>
        <br>
