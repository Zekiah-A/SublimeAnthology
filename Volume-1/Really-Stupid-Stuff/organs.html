        <b> Butcher: </b> Did you mean Guts kind sir? Well i`ll be surprised <br>
        <b> Person: </b> No I meant organs <br>
        <b> Butcher: </b> Haha! very funny joke, no I`m sure you meant Guts <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Uncool visage of decrepid death, <br>
        Come face the last breath, <br>
        Down, it lies, underneath <br>
        Stack of stones and long lost <br>
        Bones. A coincidence of sorrow. <br>
        <br>
        A man once took a leap here, <br>
        To the tombs below. <br>
        <br>
        A wreath of organs. <br>
        Encrusted fate. <br>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: larger;">”Olemme haudan tuomareita. Ja julistamme sinun olevan: </p> <br>

        <p style="font-size: x-large;">ベルセルク”</p> <br>

        So it came to in finality, <br>
        Through equilibrium of, <br>
        Pain. Torture. <br>
        Blood and Guts and Guts and Blood and Blood and Guts and Guts and Blood and Blood and Guts and Guts and Blood and Blood and Guts and Guts and Blood and Blood and Guts and Guts and Blood and Blood and Guts and Guts and Blood and Blood and Guts and Guts and Blood and Blood and Guts and Guts and Blood and Blood and Guts.<br>
        <br>
        Did you do it because you could? <br>
        Because you persuaded yourself? <br>
        Who. Where. Why. When. What. <br>
        How. <br>
        <br>
        Words etched into a blade of stone. <br>
        <br>
        To Finland we ride next morn. <br>
