They are circles instead. \u0001A hundred agonies in icing and jam, \u0001From which most kids will pick one or two. \u0001\u0001But I wander as I wonder \u0001right under the desks \u0001and remember, remember my insulin levels. \u0001\u0001Oh come all ye Faithful! Joyful and triumphant \u0001This christmas I WON’T give my heart! \u0001BECAUSE I’M GLUCOSE INTOLERANT \u0001\u0001Hark the Herald crisps explode! \u0001Glory to, the storm of crumbs! \u0001For plastic gifts have been traversed afar \u0001The floor is now plastered in chewing gum... \u0001\u0001So I tell you, my dear friend: \u0001On Christmas eve, On Christmas day \u0001Forget the sugar, forget the presents, \u0001From Santa’s beard should you run away. \u0001\u0001","pageStyle":"centre","pageBackground":""}
