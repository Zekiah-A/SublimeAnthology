They are circles instead. <br>\nA hundred agonies in icing and jam, <br>\nFrom which most kids will pick one or two. <br>\n<br>\nBut I wander as I wonder <br>\nright under the desks <br>\nand remember, remember my insulin levels. <br>\n<br>\nOh come all ye Faithful! Joyful and triumphant <br>\nThis christmas I WON’T give my heart! <br>\nBECAUSE I’M GLUCOSE INTOLERANT <br>\n<br>\nHark the Herald crisps explode! <br>\nGlory to, the storm of crumbs! <br>\nFor plastic gifts have been traversed afar <br>\nThe floor is now plastered in chewing gum... <br>\n<br>\nSo I tell you, my dear friend: <br>\nOn Christmas eve, On Christmas day <br>\nForget the sugar, forget the presents, <br>\nFrom Santa’s beard should you run away. <br>\n<br>","pageStyle":"centre","pageBackground":""}
