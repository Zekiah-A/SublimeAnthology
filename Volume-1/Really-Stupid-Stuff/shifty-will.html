    <hr>
    <div class="poem-centre">
    <p>
      Burrowing into the sun-hidden bush, <br>
      Deep in the realm where the sun don’t shine, <br>
      Silent, sly, slithering, hushed <br>
      As all shifty know it’s a rue; a mere lie. <br>
      <br>
      Cringing into the thicks of it; seemingly harmless. <br>
      Straight out of the bush, but back into the darkness. <br>
      And right again out, as soon gone in, <br>
      Just leaving the marks, where shifty will had been. <br>
