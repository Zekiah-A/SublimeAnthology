      Badges, Strech out like an impression of Sunlight <br>
      Remind you of a memory of an Imposter's plight <br>
      In colours and patterns, like a sneer of cold command <br>
      <br>
      His bloody life in my Bloody Hands <br>
      Ionic equations, Hilya you schmuckolia <br>
      <em>Have a learning Dialogue</em> - Miss Pindolia <br>
      Auxin shows badges glistening in the wind <br>
      Like Mr Statin, for he and Gru are twins. <br> <!-- Had to censor name-->
      Badges Badges, I collect you <br>
      Chartered streets through the land. <br>
      <br>
      <em>
      Badges, thy split my heart in twain <br>
      thy slap my visage in shame <br>
      without you, wrecked is my brain <br>
      OH WHY DO YOU DRESS ME IN BORROWED ROBES, THANE?! <br>
      I must confess, that my loneliness, is killing me NOW <br>
      DON'T YOU KNOW HOW DUMB I FEEL <br>
      WHEN YOU TAKE THEM AWAY, JUST LIKE YOUR WIGGGGGGGGG <br>
      <span style="color: red;"> Mr Statin, get ready for Cardi B... </span> <br>
