    <p>
        I swerve right through each chartered lane <br>
        Through where the Met. Police does watch, <br>
        It just ticked Acht, <br>
        At misty Mill Hill, <br>
        At Apex Corner, hat ich ein Fehler gemacht. <br>
        <br>
        Green to Amber, I entered last. <br>
        Or it went red; someone had blundered, <br>
        "Where are you going?", hat er gesagt, <br>
        To the county, here down under! <br>
        <br>
        Wait a minute… <br>
        <br>
        "What colour's dichromate?" <br>
        Have a learning dialogue!" <br>
        It’s kind of like orangeade, <br>
        Not green or red. <br>
        <br>
        therefore, I rightfully crossed. <br>
        I aced it in Chemistry, except not really, <br>
        It’s 8:10 now! Will I make it? How? <br>
        At the traffic lights, I did a wheelie. <br>
        "You stupid idiot!" Why did you throw, <br>
        Potassium dichromate on the bright greenol light? <br>
        In amberoic acid, now I row! <br>
        <br>
        It’s eight fifteen and there’s roadworks ahead! <br>
        The fat-clogged sewer, to amend. <br>
        Thankfully, it’s greenol, they let me go. <br>
        <br>
        That’s my last traffic light, erased from my mind, <br>
        Yet that treacherous bend and heaping hill, <br>
        Second by second, the time does kill. <br>
        <br>
        Blood will have oxygen, <br>
        My VO<sub>2</sub> is maxed. <br>
        "Time is tight!" <br>
        Says Ms Whyte. <br>
        <br>
        20, SLOW DOWN! <br>
        Put on your school gown! <br>
        To thirty accelerate! Cause Ozy’s at the gate, <br>
        For uniform slips to release, does he wait. <br>
        <br>
        His heart that fed and his hand that mocked, <br>
        God knows how many detentions hath he clocked. <br>
        Twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four? <br>
        Perhaps a thousand and a hundred more. <br>
        <br>
        "Mr Ozy, please have Mercy!" <br>
        Ten then nine, <br>
        Martin thought it fine, <br>
        "But aerobic respiration has its limits!" says Miss Tran <br>
        "Shut your mouth and move you rat!" <br> <!--PROPOSAL: swine -->
        Or you'll end up under my tyre, flat! <br> <!--PROPOSAL: 'Cause I am cycling out of time!-->
        <br>
        Eight, <br>
        Now I’m charging at the gate, <br>
        Seven, six, five, <br>
        In the car park I dive, <br>
        Four and three two, <br>
        It’s clear ahead, phew. <br>
        One, over the hump, <br>
        and it’s done… <br>
        <br>
        On the 59th second of the 19th minute of the 8th hour of January the eighth, <br>
        That’s the last student, who made it through the gate. <br>
        <br>
