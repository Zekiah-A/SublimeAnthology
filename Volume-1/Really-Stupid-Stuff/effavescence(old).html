    <p>
        Sounds in physics, <br>
        sound at home, waves, longitudional, <br>
        transferring through flesh and <br>
        bone. <br>
        <br>
        Inescapable sounds of sorrow, <br>
        of death at war unravels, <br>
        travels at a terrific speed, <br>
        faster than the richest steeds, <br>
        faster than the poorest slums, <br>
        but slower than a firing gun. <br>
        You can't run. From these waves, <br>
        the rate they vibrate, <br>
        is faster than any machine, that you could try make. <br>
        No debate. <br>
        <br>
        I don't rate all of this dissipated noise. <br>
        From idiots, schizos, so settle down, boys, <br>
        and enjoy the sounds, coming straight from my mouth. <br>
        Recordings of truths sound different out loud. <br>
        <br>
        Life-giving medium, air, is what sound travels through. <br>
        Sound estranged to silence, in deep space's vacuum. <br>
        <br>
