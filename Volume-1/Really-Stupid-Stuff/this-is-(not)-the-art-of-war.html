    	This is not "the art of war" <br>
        Ok? So stop reading, unless <br>
        You want me to continue... <br>
        <br>
        You are still here? Ok. <br>
        Ok. <br>
        <br>
        .... <br>
        <br>
        Erfolgreich wenn? <br>
        What do you think of something that <br>
        Is (not) "the art of war"? <br>
        <br>
        Ok, no more talking about something <br>
        That's (not) "the art of war." <br>
        <br>
        Still here? Really? <br>
        Ok, this is (not) the art of war. <br>
        Stop reading. <br>
        I think that if you think I will talk <br>
        About "the art of war" you should <br>
        Stop reading. Why is it called "the <br>
        art of war" <br>
        <br>
        Well, I will not be talking about it, or <br>
        any art! <br>
        As what you need to know is that this <br>
        is (not) "the art of war" <br>
        <br>
        Read on, go on, I dare you... <br>
        <br>
        <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never gonna give you up, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never gonna let you down <br>
        </i><br>
        See? I have won this war, it truly <br>
        was not an artful war, wouldn't you say! <br>
        Or do you think it was? <br>
        It truly was an "Erfolgreich wenn" <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><b>THE END </b></i> <br>
        <br>
