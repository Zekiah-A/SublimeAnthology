        From last summer's autumn tears,<br>
        to present summer smiles, this<br>
        pen has travelled a million miles,<br>
        Dragging it's ball across the page,<br>
        writing poems and jokes, and stuff so<br>
        gay.<br>
        <br>
        I feel sorry for it's suffering I have incurred,<br>
        luckily the pen's screams can not be heard <span class="ILfuVd"><b>ðŸ˜Ž.<br>
        <br>
        </b>And as I write now, I grin as I sit,<br>
        goodbye pen, you're being replaced.<br>
        </span><br>
