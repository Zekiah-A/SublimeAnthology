Police does watch, <br>\nIt just ticked Acht, <br>\nAt misty Mill Hill, <br>\nAt Apex Corner, hat ich ein Fehler gemacht. <br>\n<br>\nGreen to Amber, I entered last. <br>\nOr it went red; someone had blundered, <br>\n\"Where are you going?\", hat er gesagt, <br>\nTo the county, here down under! <br>\n<br>\nWait a minute… <br>\n<br>\n\"What colour's dichromate?\" <br>\nHave a learning dialogue!\" <br>\nIt’s kind of like orangeade, <br>\nNot green or red. <br>\n<br>\ntherefore, I rightfully crossed. <br>\nI aced it in Chemistry, except not really, <br>\nIt’s 8:10 now! Will I make it? How? <br>\nAt the traffic lights, I did a wheelie. <br>\n\"You stupid idiot!\" Why did you throw, <br>\nPotassium dichromate on the bright greenol light? <br>\nIn amberoic acid, now I row! <br>\n<br>\nIt’s eight fifteen and there’s roadworks ahead! <br>\nThe fat-clogged sewer, to amend. <br>\nThankfully, it’s greenol, they let me go. <br>\n<br>\nThat’s my last traffic light, erased from my mind, <br>\nYet that treacherous bend and heaping hill, <br>\nSecond by second, the time does kill. <br>\n<br>\nBlood will have oxygen, <br>\nMy VO<sub>2</sub> is maxed. <br>\n\"Time is tight!\" <br>\nSays Ms Whyte. <br>\n<br>\n20, SLOW DOWN! <br>\nPut on your school gown! <br>\nTo thirty accelerate! Cause Ozy’s at the gate, <br>\nFor uniform slips to release, does he wait. <br>\n<br>\nHis heart that fed and his hand that mocked, <br>\nGod knows how many detentions hath he clocked. <br>\nTwenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four? <br>\nPerhaps a thousand and a hundred more. <br>\n<br>\n\"Mr Ozy, please have Mercy!\" <br>\nTen then nine, <br>\nMartin thought it fine, <br>\n\"But aerobic respiration has its limits!\" says Miss Tran <br>\n\"Shut your mouth and move you rat!\" <br> <!--PROPOSAL: swine -->\nOr you'll end up under my tyre, flat! <br> <!--PROPOSAL: 'Cause I am cycling out of time!-->\n<br>\nEight, <br>\nNow I’m charging at the gate, <br>\nSeven, six, five, <br>\nIn the car park I dive, <br>\nFour and three two, <br>\nIt’s clear ahead, phew. <br>\nOne, over the hump, <br>\nand it’s done… <br>\n<br>\nOn the 59th second of the 19th minute of the 8th hour of January the eighth, <br>\nThat’s the last student, who made it through the gate. <br>\n<br>","pageStyle":"e","pageBackground":""}
