    <p>
        A road with two exits (or enterances), <br>
        one out and one in. I am a receptor, inspector <br>
        of this road. And I swear I did not hear no <br>
        shouts or no din, but you emerged with a devlish <br>
        grin, like some schitzo with no empathy within, or <br>
        some damn god-forsaken subliminal sin <br>
        <br>
        But you Win. <br>
        <br>
        So tell me what happened on persely road? <br>
        One enterance, one exit, a whole lifetime between. <br>
        Because it is now 5:13 and that poor dog there <br>
        is DEAD. <br>
        DEAD. <br>
        Once loved, now in a pool of blood and it's incredibly <br>
        sus, there's a fine line through it's head so it couldn't <br>
        be the 6:05 bus, and on your bike wheels there's a <br>
        hell's sea amount of goo, and there's red on your shoe, so it has <br>
        to be new, and you're the only person who went down this road, <br>
        so therefore, <br>
        It must've been You. <br>
