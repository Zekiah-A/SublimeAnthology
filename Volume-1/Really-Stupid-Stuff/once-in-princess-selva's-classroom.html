        Oh Christmas eve,
        Oh Christmas day,
        From Santa’s beard I’m running away.
        
        It’s period 1 and form time’s done,
        I charge up the stairs and torch that fat.
        I coil in the lockers under tall guys and girls
        But the reindeer’s shadow
        Casts through the door
        
        We’re summoned inside
        Last Christmas is sung
        Oh holy night, the stars chose to hide.
        
        Time for math, were squared and cubed,
        But where are the tables? They are circles instead.
        A hundred agonies in icing and jam,
        From which most kids will pick one or two.
        
        But I wander as I wonder
        right under the desks
        and remember, remember my insulin levels.

        Oh come all ye Faithful! Joyful and triumphant
        This christmas I WON’T give my heart!
        BECAUSE I’M GLUCOSE INTOLERNT
        
        Hark the Herald crisps explode!
        Glory to, the storm of crumbs!
        For plastic gifts have been traversed afar
        The floor is now plastered in chewing gum...
        
        So I tell you, my dear friend:
        On Christmas eve, On Christmas day
        Forget the sugar, forget the presents,
        From Santa’s beard should you run away.
