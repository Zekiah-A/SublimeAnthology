        Oh Christmas eve, <br>
        Oh Christmas day, <br>
        From Santa’s beard I’m running away. <br>
        <br>
        It’s period 1 and form time’s done, <br>
        I charge up the stairs and torch that fat. <br>
        I coil in the lockers under tall guys and girls <br>
        But the reindeer’s shadow <br>
        Casts through the door <br>
        <br>
        We’re summoned inside <br>
        Last Christmas is sung <br>
        Oh holy night, the stars chose to hide. <br>
        <br>
        Time for math, were squared and cubed, <br>
        But where are the tables? They are circles instead. <br>
        A hundred agonies in icing and jam, <br>
        From which most kids will pick one or two. <br>
        <br>
        But I wander as I wonder <br>
        right under the desks <br>
        and remember, remember my insulin levels. <br>
        <br>
        Oh come all ye Faithful! Joyful and triumphant <br>
        This christmas I WON’T give my heart! <br>
        BECAUSE I’M GLUCOSE INTOLERNT <br>
        <br>
        Hark the Herald crisps explode! <br>
        Glory to, the storm of crumbs! <br>
        For plastic gifts have been traversed afar <br>
        The floor is now plastered in chewing gum... <br>
        <br>
        So I tell you, my dear friend: <br>
        On Christmas eve, On Christmas day <br>
        Forget the sugar, forget the presents, <br>
        From Santa’s beard should you run away. <br>
        <br>
