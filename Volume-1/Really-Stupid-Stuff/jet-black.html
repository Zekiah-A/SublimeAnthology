    <p>
      The harmony of nature is equivocated, as<br>
      the racist is reintroduced into the habitat.<br>
      The second coming of Christ, a noble man,<br>
      yet his profile picture's a lie; Jetstream Sam.<br>
      <br>
      So don't expect any apologies<br>
      If you're German, and conjure a rant,<br>
      Rant turned to endless gifs and memes<br>
      but your suffering has only just began.<br>
      <br>
      N-words, b-words, f-words, et-cetera,<br>
      fired at the American weeb's impenetrable defenses,<br>
      immune by their lack of basic cognition,<br>
      Yet for Jetstream Sam, only more ammunition,<br>
      <br>
      Little remains of the channel, here and now,<br>
      lest the few who still remain,<br>
      small talk echoes thought the server,<br>
      fearing the attacks of Jetstream Sam again.<br>
