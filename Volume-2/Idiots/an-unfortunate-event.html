        12 Gauge shotgun, pulled up, death crows. <br>
        Across his door is a beastly sight <br>
        Something dangerous, something with a short height, <br>
        Vegan badge and blue hair. <br>
        What, Why, Who? When, How, Where? <br>
        <br>
        "Exonmobil is my friend" calls the farmer <br>
        "Liberals are Republicans" <br>
        What? <br>
        <span style="font-size: x-large;">BANG BANG BANG&nbsp;&nbsp;3 BULLETS OF IDIOCITY</span> <br>
        Fired from the farmer's gun. <br>
        <br>
        Dead man in front of him. Spilt soymilk, his flat white <br>
        vegan soy tall latte sorta inside out. <br>
        And it's over, but not really. <br>
        <br>
        3 flying seagulls fly above, 3 of a kind, <br>
        all letting fly. PLOP, PLOP, PLOP, <br>
        Choked by excrament the farmer <br>
        Gurgles. Liberal Birds. <br>
        The beer and redpills won't flush it out. <br>
        The farmer regrets his choice, but not really, <br>
        The beer and redpills <em>do</em> flush it out. <br>
        The farmer burps. <br>
        He puts on his boots and jumps into a <br>
        Tractor. <br>
        <br>
        "Time to farm some lives" <br>
        Cackling, the creature's skin turned stone, almost <br>
        As stone as a rock. The END. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-size: xx-small;">(except not really)</span> <br>
