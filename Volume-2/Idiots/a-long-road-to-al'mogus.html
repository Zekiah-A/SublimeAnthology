    <h2 class="centre"> A long road to Al'mogus - By Zekiah </h2>
    <hr>
    <div class="poem-centre">
    <p>
        Earth and Bones, old sticks and stones, <br>
        Just one long road to Al'mogus. <br>
        Sandles, seared by the sun-struck path, <br>
        oh how I wish I had taken the car. <br>
        All for a land, oh so, so far. <br>
        Struggling to Al'mogus. <br>
        <br>
        A vulture, flew overhead, <br>
        then dropped down dead! Beating <br>
        my back like a brick of lead. Yet I <br>
        Shouted 'horay', meat for days! <br>
        On my way to Al'mogus. <br>
        <br>
        Fingers blue and black, have left the track. <br>
        A new track of red, and filled with dread, <br>
        I finally fall, and smash my head, <br>
        I start dreaming about Al'mogus. <br>
        <br>
        <em>
        A winding road once lead to a land a far, <br>
        of wealth and riches, gold and cars. <br>
        Yet barren bodies of idiots lined it's paths, <br>
        An American dream of Al'mogus. <br>
        </em>
