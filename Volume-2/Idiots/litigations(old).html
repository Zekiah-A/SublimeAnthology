    <p>Sickly pale,<br>
as he beats it as fast as his<br>
large American body can.<br>
Beating the enter key,<br>
with useless waifu spam.<br>
<br>
Rem desktop background,<br>
burned into his graphics card.<br>
Rem body pillow, in his brute-sized bed,<br>
hard.<br>
<br>
"I am not a weeb cause I like other stuff",<br>
he retorted,<br>
"He said that Islam was a country in Africa",<br>
zekiahepic reported.<br>
<br>
And as a cycles blender render, displaying<br>
schwartz stories in black and white,<br>
and the hanging Rem 3D model,<br>
at 10PM, night.<br>
Zekiah, Major, Bushi<br>
looked upon their screens,<br>
And observed the circus of midday anime rants,<br>
from the clown weeb.<br>
