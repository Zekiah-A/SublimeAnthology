The clown of the town, \u0001inactive activists rant. \u0001\u0001And as I pass by the crossing, I stare down the street, \u0001same story, as always, \u0001black square on her screen. \u0001\u0001As you barge past her large body, \u0001made a mistake you'll regret, \u0001as you smack \u0001their/her/his/xer vegan soymilk starbucks latte \u0001 on the road. \u0001\u0001The concorde blasts quiet, compared to her \u0001shrill shriek, RACISM, SEXISM, HOMOPHOBIA, \u0001MYSOGONY, \u0001prepare to shut your brain off, as she cries \u0001\u0001Think about her poor voice, when she's \u0001dead at 55. \u0001\u0001Think about about the blue dye washing over her saggy  \u0001fuselage, as the wind starts blowing. \u0001\u0001Think about the poor flakes, when it \u0001starts snowing. \u0001\u0001Then question how can someone who posts so \u0001much positivity and peace on instagram, facebook, and even her tweets \u0001be the most vulgar-mouthed bitch, \u0001as she rolls down the street. \u0001\u0001","pageStyle":"centre","pageBackground":""}
