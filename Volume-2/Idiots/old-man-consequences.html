    <p>
        Billious green, <br>
        grillious bile, <br>
        happy to sad, sad to smile, <br>
        knife to skin, wrinkled to cut, <br>
        Smile to pain, pain to blood. <br>
        <br>
        Sawing the knife blade, back again, <br>
        he pains, but smiles, happy he bled, <br>
        Happy in hell, you won't remember his name, <br>
        growing seeds with his blood, <br>
        as he let it rain. <br>
