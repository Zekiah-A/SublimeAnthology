        The test is over,<br>
        the marking has begun,<br>
        <i>"MISS MISS MISSSS<br>
        Can I have one mark here<br>
        MISS<br>
        Please just one",<br>
        </i><br>
        The class is livid, everyone with<br>
        their hands in their ears, sick of<br>
        their retarded cry<i>,<br>
        </i>"You don't need any more FUCKING<br>
        marks, you have grade 9."<br>
        You're wasting time, It's just a mistake,<br>
        You can't do this in your GCSEs,<br>
        You're making us late, to break,<br>
        and lunch, and life, and going home,<br>
        So respectfully,<br>
        Enjoy your grade,<br>
        Control your emotions,<br>
        Please, just ask after,<br>
        It's just a number.<br>
        <br>
        It makes no difference,<br>
        Do we care? <b>NO!</b><br>
