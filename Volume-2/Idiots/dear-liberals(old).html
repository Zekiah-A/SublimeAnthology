    <p>
        Our golden eagle, <br>
        men wreched, wings outstrech'd <br>
        the ancestral blood of the constitution, <br>
        a great force, we strike back! Against communism! <br>
        Masks, Guns, et-cetera, TRUMP, <br>
        all things we throw in the dump! <br>
        Because we declare, our glorious nation, <br>
        has been shot in the right wing by this abomination. <br>
        <em>LIBERALS</em> <br>
        <br>
        The growing SHEEP, <br>
        those god-sinned snakes, <br>
        Can't they see that the virus is FAKE. <br>
        BLM - Just a bunch of looters, <br>
        gun laws stay the <u>same</u>! <br>
        There's no such thing as school sho- <br>
        The vaccine's FAKE, <br>
        The earth is FLAT, <br>
        The scientists are STUPID- <br>
        They're probably bla- <br>
        All these ideologies are way too NEW. <br>
        The only LGBT I know is on MY BARBECUE! <br>
        Eating FRUIT and VEG is not good for your HEALTH! <br>
        DON'T ask me for a source, because the source is MYSELF. <br>
        So I'll pack my US flag, <br>
        AND US made bunting, <br>
        Y'all watch out! I'm going Liberal Hunting. <br>
