Et-cetera, drugs,\u0001Police chasing cars at 140 miles per hour – thugs,\u0001For driving how fast, like 80 or 90?\u0001\u0001Kinetic energy and gears – I treasure your velocity but\u0001Dem tell me, dem tell me, don’t go more than forty\u0001But dem chase me at fifty in the pitch-black narrow road.\u0001And blind me with their azure headlamps.\u0001\u0001It’s a game, a playground game!\u0001Of cops and robbers,\u0001Or perhaps I’m being hunted by a dodgy imposter!\u000120% gradient and the bloodstream’s infused, with ketones and glucose,\u0001Now, I won’t ever stop.\u0001\u0000\u0005\u0000\u0001\u0002Suddenly a sickly green witch emerges,\u0001From the gutter at the side or the thorny green hedges.\u0001It’s not a ghost, IT’S A LIVING MAN!\u0001I instinctively clutch the handles of the breaks,\u0001And slam them till they’ve melted away.\u0000\u0005\u0000\u0001\u0001‘‘Are you crazy, ya menace to society!\u000151mph down a road meant for 40?\u0001Gimme thirty pounds, you idiot, ya rascal’’\u0001\u0002Avant and quit my sight you man of idiocity!\u0001You sped and chased me with heaps of animosity,\u0001Your hand that preys on little innocent victims,\u0001And steers right over red lights and zebra crossings,\u0001You are the one who ‘‘verbally abuses’’,\u0001And your accelerator pedal, constantly misuses.\u0001You are the menace, you are the idiot,\u0001You deserve the heaviest fine,\u0001Therefore, my hard earned thirty pounds are \u0000\u0004\u0000MINE\u0002.\u0001","pageStyle":"poem-centre","pageBackground":""}
