When, How, Where? \u0001\u0001\"Exonmobil is my friend\" calls the farmer \u0001\"Liberals are Republicans\" \u0001What? \u0001BANG BANG BANG3 BULLETS OF IDIOCITY\u0002 \u0001Fired from the farmer's gun. \u0001\u0001Dead man in front of him. Spilt soymilk, his flat white \u0001vegan soy tall latte sorta inside out. \u0001And it's over, but not really. \u0001\u00013 flying seagulls fly above, 3 of a kind, \u0001all letting fly. PLOP, PLOP, PLOP, \u0001Choked by excrament the farmer \u0001Gurgles. Liberal Birds. \u0001The beer and redpills won't flush it out. \u0001The farmer regrets his choice, but not really, \u0001The beer and redpills \u0000\u0005\u0000do\u0002 flush it out. \u0001The farmer burps. \u0001He puts on his boots and jumps into a \u0001Tractor. \u0001\u0001\"Time to farm some lives\" \u0001Cackling, the creature's skin turned stone, almost \u0001As stone as a rock.
