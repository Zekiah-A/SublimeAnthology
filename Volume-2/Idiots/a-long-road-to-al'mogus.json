Beating \u0001my back like a brick of lead. Yet I \u0001Shouted 'horay', meat for days! \u0001On my way to Al'mogus. \u0001\u0001Fingers blue and black, have left the track. \u0001A new track of red, and filled with dread, \u0001I finally fall, and smash my head, \u0001I start dreaming about Al'mogus. \u0001\u0001\u0000\u0005\u0000A winding road once lead to a land a far, \u0001of wealth and riches, gold and cars. \u0001Yet barren bodies of idiots lined it's paths, \u0001An American dream of Al'mogus. \u0001\u0002\u0001","pageStyle":"centre","pageBackground":""}
