    <p>
        Yesterday, or another day, I waked out into a crowd <br>
        I looked around, and my ears were blasted out <br>
        by the deathening of the thump, cries, screams, <br>
        a ritual, <br>
        'TRUMP' <br>
        <br>
        And it wasn't ironic or some joke, <br>
        I swear I saw the pope, <br>
        And on large gallows, I saw a statue erect, <br>
        a poor portrait, a precedent of the US <br>
        <br>
        so I walked up to the gallows, <br>
        put my head in the hanging rope, <br>
        told a man to pull the lever, <br>
        in the nuts, I kicked the pope <br>
        <br>
        And as I started falling, <br>
        there was one last thing I tried to say, <br>
        "I DECLARE THAT YOU ARE ALL IDIOTS", <br>
        I still believe this 'til my dying day. <br>
        <br>
