    <p>
      In the dark, of the lair, <br>
      dark and dank, dorito crisps, <br>
      piss stained carpets and hollowed corpses of <br>
      Something much, or something else. <br>
      Suffocated by the smell, within mid flight, <br>
      and illuminated by a rainbow of lights, <br>
      "bruh that's ga-" <br>
      <br>
      Then Blasted through by dual AKs, <br>
      Scopes, aimed in right at the beast, <br>
      A horrific image of flesh wrapp'd bone, <br>
      On the doorstep of death's door, <br>
      covered in sweat and coated in grease. <br>
      <br>
      And as each barrel opened wide, <br>
      Metal becomes light, as it reaches <br> 
      speed. And punches through layer <br>
      after layer of skin and bone, plastering <br>
      the computer screen. <br>
      <br>
      This all happened, <br>
      except it didn't; <br>
      "Game over" engraved on the LCD, <br>
      <em>"Gamer simulator 2021 has good graphics"</em>, <br>
      a human read. <br>
      On his macbook, in the park <br>
      <em>"Yet here in nature I can't see this screen"</em> <br>
      Why are gamers potrayal so dark? <br>
      <br>
