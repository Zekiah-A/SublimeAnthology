    <p>
        So this Sunday, treat all others with love kindness and compassion. <br>
        You SLIMY SINNERS, you freaking scum, <br>
        Can't you see my godly duty's done? <br> <!--PROPOSAL: "I'm not high enough for this crap, my godly duty's done.""-->
        <em>"I'm sorry priest, I must confess"</em> <br>
        I couldn't give a fuck if you're damned or blessed! <br>
        <br>
        My sheep are starving, my basement's dark, <br>
        screw this family business. Hark! <br>
        the herald angel screams and sings, <br>
        I'm mad with power, god made <em>me</em> king. <br>
        <br>
        So now with this service, we gently proceed, <br>
        open the bibles, turn to page 3, and then piss on it <br>
        'til you make a hole, this stupid book won't <br>
        save your soul! <br>
        <br>
        My way is the <strong>ONLY</strong> way to be religious, <br>
        that old man's work is just sacrilegious <br>
        Punish the body to spare the soul <br>
        even if you have to end your life. <br>
        Punish the soul to save the body <br>
        And spare those trees and foxes lives. <br>
        <br>
        You may have priority on the road, <br>
        but you're breaching heaven's code <br>
        Fuck your wellbeing, screw your health <br>
        <span style="color: rgb(100, 0, 0);">build a cross and kill yourself!</span> <br>
        <br>
        Deny thy doctors, deny thy teachers. <br>
        All the little french boys know, <br>
        to accept, <br>
        thy, <br>
        PREACHER! <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-size: xx-small;">(I'll be posting some pron tomorrow <br>
        so keep in touch kids! I mean, it <em>is</em> <br>
        the grand Methodist church afterall)</span> <br>
