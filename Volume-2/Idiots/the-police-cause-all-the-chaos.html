        <hr>
    </div>
    <div class="centre">
    <p>Take out your Formula 1 on the brand-new road,<br>
        And race up the right lane at full speed mode,<br>
        Swerve from right to left,<br>
        Overtake police cars with utter contempt.<br>
        <br>
        Flashing blue lights,<br>
        Pull to the right!<br>
        There’s been a murderer, A WINK MURDERER! Et-cetera, drugs,<br>
        Police chasing cars at 140 miles per hour – thugs,<br>
        For driving how fast, like 80 or 90?<br>
        <br>
        Kinetic energy and gears – I treasure your velocity but<br>
        Dem tell me, dem tell me, don’t go more than forty<br>
        But dem chase me at fifty in the pitch-black narrow road.<br>
        And blind me with their azure headlamps.<br>
        <br>
        It’s a game, a playground game!<br>
        Of cops and robbers,<br>
        Or perhaps I’m being hunted by a dodgy imposter!<br>
        20% gradient and the bloodstream’s infused, with ketones and glucose,<br>
        Now, I won’t ever stop.<br>
        <i><br>
        </i>Suddenly a sickly green witch emerges,<br>
        From the gutter at the side or the thorny green hedges.<br>
        It’s not a ghost, IT’S A LIVING MAN!<br>
        I instinctively clutch the handles of the breaks,<br>
        And slam them till they’ve melted away.<i><br>
        <br>
        ‘‘Are you crazy, ya menace to society!<br>
        51mph down a road meant for 40?<br>
        Gimme thirty pounds, you idiot, ya rascal’’<br>
        </i>Avant and quit my sight you man of idiocity!<br>
        You sped and chased me with heaps of animosity,<br>
        Your hand that preys on little innocent victims,<br>
        And steers right over red lights and zebra crossings,<br>
        You are the one who ‘‘verbally abuses’’,<br>
        And your accelerator pedal, constantly misuses.<br>
        You are the menace, you are the idiot,<br>
        You deserve the heaviest fine,<br>
        Therefore, my hard earned thirty pounds are <b>MINE</b>.<br>
