        He looked to the tree and saw in it, <br>
        Irony of society <br>
        So he cut it down. <br>
        <br>
        Carbon. Dioxide. Molecules. <br>
        Burn the tree, fell beastly industrious fires, <br>
        Rage to destroy the forest. <br>
        <br>
        "I hate nature", give me money for oxidation <br>
        of alluminium so I can recieve Alluminium <br>
        But Oxide! Alluminium Oxide! <br>
        <br>
        Ionic particles, never ending parabellum, mind into <br>
        Equilibrium, Sibbilance, Susilance, Vent anger, <br>
        Get into THE VENT. It's over but not over, <br>
        WeaveTheLorax. Mr O'Hare burns the grass, <br>
        Oxide of carbon C<sub>12</sub>N<sub>5</sub>O<sub>6</sub>Pb<sub>3</sub>Og<sub>90</sub>S<sub>5</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O <br>
        Hydrocarbon of death. <br>
        <br>
        Look at the tree, dead it lays, let it's <br>
        death be a SUSURE CEASURE SOS. <br>
        Shattered visage of oak and trees, a visage of <br>
        the dead of the night twists to the <br>
        undergrowth means death to all. Dead. <br>
        Dead. Dead. Among the growth is a vent. <br>
        And here it all ends, as if it <br>
        hath all begun. <br>
        <br>
        Do wrong or death do nothing wrong, <br>
        Stab or Stab wrong or are the vents <br>
        AMONG US <br>
        <br>
