    <p>
    	So this last day of school,<br>
        When you’ve aced your last exam,<br>
        Forget those lies and rip off your tie,<br>
        Tear your school trousers in a pair of ripped jeans,<br>
        Put your blazer under the guillotine,<br>
        Till it’s hanging strips of blue and red.<br>
        Fling your tie against the playground fence,<br>
        And scribble on the fabric, in black whiteboard pen,<br>
        Hark the Herald, Hail the woods!<br>
        Glory to the ‘‘Book of fame’’<br>
        - Insert a quote of dignity and inspiration<br>
        - Shut up! You Year Heads of abomination<br>
        That’s my quote for you eternally doomed,<br>
        Don’t like it? I’m fine in the Withdrawal Room.<br>
        And meet me up with Mr Statin,<br>
        To teach him the fate of OzyAndy.<br>
        ‘‘Upload a yearbook photo’’<br>
        NO is my moto<br>
        <br>
        For Google Classroom’s chock full of lies,<br>
        Waffle, waffle in physics and biology,<br>
        Mice eat cats and cats eat mice,<br>
        "See me at lunch." You forgot to circle that anomaly.<br>
        Respiration is just combustion of glucose,<br>
        And photosynthesis – just CO2 in a test tube!<br>
        Don’t bother writing a single bit more,<br>
        See I told you! One out of four!<br>
        Your sketchbook's too abstract! Your portrait’s too pale,<br>
        Unfortunately, It will all have to be a total fail,<br>
        The sun looks too mellow,<br>
        You need more yellow.<br>
        Does it have to glow?<br>
        Skitzgerald said so!<br>
        Everything is watched,<br>
        Did I run? Did I walk?<br>
        Am I sweating or wet, or smell of ammonia?<br>
        - Careful, you’ll catch bronchitis and pneumonia!’’<br>
        - Fuck off you Spazpole and Martin, your boyfriend!<br>
        For none of you are my Mum or Dad.<br>
        If you make keeping fit more so of a pain,<br>
        We will end up obese and lame. <em><sub>(like you)</sub></em><br>
        <br>
        Besides:<br>
        Those five aside fucking footie fanatics,<br>
        For each touch, each goal between the coats and bags – just pedantic,<br>
        You accuse me of only my glistening sweat,<br>
        But the footie players are the ones, who their seats do wet!<br>
        Dem never asked me if this made me puke,<br>
        But my mere morning jog, they rebuke.<br>
        Democracy is DEAD. Bojo sealed his approval,<br>
        His head of a mop and his eyes of ice,<br>
        On parliament did he STOMP twice.<br>
        SHN – Stay home now! Protect our fantastic NHS!<br>
        In your fantasy it lies, you idiot, you clown-punk.<br>
        So resign right now and clear your muck,<br>
        About your regulations, we don’t give a fuck.<br>
        Our life revolves around one CT,<br>
        Oh no invalid! Just the T, no C!<br>
        Lies, lies, lies, these are all LIES,<br>
        But we believe them<br>
        Why? For the benefit and satisfaction,<br>
        A pointless endeavor.<br>
        Of a minuscule fraction! <br>
        <br>
