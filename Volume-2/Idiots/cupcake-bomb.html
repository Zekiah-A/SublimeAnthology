        ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ Ukraine: Hey guys, could we get some reinforcements?<br>
        <br>
        ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Second Officer: Look sir, we can't, it's too dangerou-<br>
        ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Captain: Unleash it.<br>
        <br>
        Helicopters blast the hair off the poles,<br>
        as they speed over the border of Ukraine,<br>
        Rotors at MAX rpm, swerving from left<br>
        to right, as they carry a heavy load below.<br>
        <br>
        Fastened by carabiners and ropes of steel,<br>
        Chinhooks, apaches, jets and more,<br>
        guiding the weapon of colossal destruction to<br>
        the killing place.<br>
        <br>
        In Kyiv now, and as the red sun starts to set,<br>
        beauty for a moment, as each rope falls slack,<br>
        a huge shadow casting over each apartment in darkness,<br>
        the children hidden in the bunkers draw close to the cracks, in the walls,<br>
        <br>
        to observe as the colossal giant, in wonder<br>
        slowly descends with the force of a thousand nukes,<br>
        an eir of insatiable tranquility for the few moments before impact, as the <br>
        orange sunset light falls behind...<br>
        <br>
        Then a shock wave, throwing them under rubble,<br>
        as buildings collapse in the feverish heat of the impact, uprooting every tank and gunner,<br>
        a colossal divot forms, ripping and devouring the flesh of the earth,<br>
        like EDP taking a bite into daughter nature's cupcake, after luring it into the deceitful wake of his destruction,<br>
        and exploding in the centre of the town.<br>
        <br>
        ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Second Officer: I'lll be the first to say that I was wrong, good work, Cap'n.<br>
        <br>
        Hiroshima, Nagasaki<br>
        <br>
        ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Captain: I mean, we do God's work upholding democracy.<br>
        <br>
        Little of Ukraine yet remains.<br>
        Same case with Afghanistan, Syria and that other place.<br>
        <br>
        ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Second Officer: Wait, so who were we fighting again this time, the Russians?<br>
        <br>
        Ready to deploy the EDP again.<br>
        <br>
