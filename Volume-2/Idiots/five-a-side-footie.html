        Oi Oi, Enga-land, It's coooming home, <br>
        GCSE PE Grade 1! <br>
        Debating with the boooys, <br>
        If Ronaldo is the worst, if <br>
        Messi is the best, gonna have a hit at <br>
        the chippie after the game, <br>
        but first "What are you doing REF!" <br>
        <br>
        wanna hear a joke? Arsenal's defense! <br>
        Spent all my money on footie games, <br>
        I'm running out of rent. <br>
        But FOOTIE 24/7, is all have with <br>
        me friends <br>
        And every time they miss a shot, got <br>
        me hands up on my head. <br>
        <br>
        Footie is my whole life, <br>
        watching on TV, <br>
        almost homeless, crappy apartment, <br>
        screaming at the screen, <br>
        lost my wife, alcahol addict, <br>
        to be a baller was my dream, <br>
        Just another brute in the crowd <br>
        My identity is my team. <br>
        <br>
        So Oi Oi Liiions, <br>
        I may just look insane, <br>
        but you should understand, Idiot, why I rant <br>
        after the game. <br>
        <br>
        My white, chicken tikka <br>
        eating mates and I shout racial slurs right at that ref. <br>
        <br>
        Faking physical injuries, that blind bollocks <br>
        bastard. <br>
        <br>
        <em>And booting him to death.</em> <br>
        <br>
