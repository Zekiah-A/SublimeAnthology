        The man stepped down into the cell, padded walls, blank grey, <br>
        Grey as his mind. The man, the automaton in his grey <br>
        suit, his grey briefcase. And then he accepted his seat. <br>
        the last of his will tied itself into the electric chair, <br>
        the matte, grey wool bluntly smitten with nothing. Nothing, <br>
        Creativity had been sent to die and it would. <br>
        The blank walls, the blank walls not even grey entombed the <br>
        faceless, shameless man evermore. <br>
