        Machine Whirs Like Urea In The <br>
        Wind That Carries Society <br>
        On It's Cold Castle In The <br>
        Grass. <br>
        <br>
        "I like society" said a man, his <br>
        name was "I". <br>
        "Society is Potassium Dichromate (IV)" <br>
        said a woman whose name was "Society" <br>
        "I am Society" said an idiot. <br>
        <br>
        They lived in a society, of idiots. <br>
        Nature around them whirled into <br>
        Sand and there they were. <br>
        At a shattered visage, because <br>
        all cliffs have a summit. <br>
        <br>
