        Each time I walk through the woke side of city,
        4 times out of 1, I hear an opinion so
        shitty.

        Blue dyed hair, chubby fingers, short
        stance. The clown of the town,
        inactive activists rant.

        And as I pass by the crossing, I stare down the street,
        same story, as always,
        black square on her screen.

        As you barge past her large body,
        made a mistake you'll regret,
        as you smack
        their/her/his/xer vegan soymilk starbucks latte <!--PROPOSAL "coffe" instead of latte. -->
        on the road.

        The concorde blasts quiet, compared to her
        shrill shriek, RACISM, SEXISM, HOMOPHOBIA,
        MYSOGONY,
        prepare to shut your brain off, as she cries

        Think about her poor voice, when she's
        dead at 55.
        
        Think about about the blue dye washing over her saggy 
        fuselage, as the wind starts blowing.

        Think about the poor flakes, when it
        starts snowing.

        The question how can someone who posts so
        much positivity and peace on insta,
        be the most vulgar-mouthed bitch,
        as she rolls down the street.
