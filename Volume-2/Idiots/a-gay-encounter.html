    <p> <!--Could also be parodies and adaptations.-->
        Each time I walk through the woke side of city, <br>
        4 times out of 1, I hear an opinion so <br>
        shitty. <br>
        <br>
        Blue dyed hair, chubby fingers, short <br>
        stance. The clown of the town, <br>
        inactive activists rant. <br>
        <br>
        And as I pass by the crossing, I stare down the street, <br>
        same story, as always, <br>
        black square on her screen. <br>
        <br>
        As you barge past her large body, <br>
        made a mistake you'll regret, <br>
        as you smack <br>
        their/her/his/xer vegan soymilk starbucks latte <br> <!--PROPOSAL "coffe" instead of latte. -->
        on the road. <br>
        <br>
        The concorde blasts quiet, compared to her <br>
        shrill shriek, RACISM, SEXISM, HOMOPHOBIA, <br>
        MYSOGONY, <br>
        prepare to shut your brain off, as she cries <br>
        <br>
        Think about her poor voice, when she's <br>
        dead at 55. <br>
        <br>
        Think about about the blue dye washing over her saggy  <br>
        fuselage, as the wind starts blowing. <br>
        <br>
        Think about the poor flakes, when it <br>
        starts snowing. <br>
        <br>
        Then question how can someone who posts so <br>
        much positivity and peace on instagram, facebook, and even her tweets <br>
        be the most vulgar-mouthed bitch, <br>
        as she rolls down the street. <br>
