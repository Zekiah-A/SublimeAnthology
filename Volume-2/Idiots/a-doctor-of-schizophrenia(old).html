    <div class="poem-centre-wide">
    <p>
        Bland, fluorescent lighting, <br>
        the door's full locked, <br>
        all exits blocked, <br>
        help me, help me, help me, doc. <br>
        <br>
        This room knows of many people, it <br>
        tells me every day, tells me of patient after <br>
        patient, 'these drugs that I'm taking' <br>
        that they want to get off, but their faces <br>
        say otherwise. <br>
        <br>
        The patients here are mad, I see them bounce off the walls, <br>
        Scream down the halls, armed with these strange <br>
        kinds of guns, knives and tools, I refuse <br>
        to admit them in for anything else, their general <br>
        health all sums up to schizophrenia. <br>
        <br>
        I have written it so many times, that those keys <br>
        no longer function, I mean, <br>
        they're MAD, CRAZY, ALL INSANE, CIA <br>
        GLOWIES, how can I not sign <br>
        them up for this condition without proper diagnosis. <br>
        <br>
        It's the CIA injecting weed into their DNA. <br>
        It's all caused by mitosis, even when they're <br>
        sitting there, silent, sad, I'm convinced that they're mad in catosis, <br>
        It used to make me green sick, but <br>
        now I'm desensitised; chlorosis. These schizos <br>
        dragging me out of my freaking ward, I scream "Idiots", "Dumbasses", "Gores" <br>
        On the other side of the door. <br>
        <br>
        Now they're tryna convict me for stuff without a reason <br>
        can the CIA not See? <br>
        Two years later on drugs, behind bars in prison, <br>
        I come to a revelation. <br>
        The schizo was me. <br>
        <br>
