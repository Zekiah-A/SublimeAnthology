You Year Heads of abomination\u0001That’s my quote for you eternally doomed,\u0001Don’t like it? I’m fine in the Withdrawal Room.\u0001And meet me up with Mr Statin,\u0001To teach him the fate of OzyAndy.\u0001‘‘Upload a yearbook photo’’\u0001NO is my moto\u0001\u0001For Google Classroom’s chock full of lies,\u0001Waffle, waffle in physics and biology,\u0001Mice eat cats and cats eat mice,\u0001\"See me at lunch.\" You forgot to circle that anomaly.\u0001Respiration is just combustion of glucose,\u0001And photosynthesis – just CO2 in a test tube!\u0001Don’t bother writing a single bit more,\u0001See I told you! One out of four!\u0001Your sketchbook's too abstract! Your portrait’s too pale,\u0001Unfortunately, It will all have to be a total fail,\u0001The sun looks too mellow,\u0001You need more yellow.\u0001Does it have to glow?\u0001Skitzgerald said so!\u0001Everything is watched,\u0001Did I run? Did I walk?\u0001Am I sweating or wet, or smell of ammonia?\u0001- Careful, you’ll catch bronchitis and pneumonia!’’\u0001- Fuck off you Spazpole and Martin, your boyfriend!\u0001For none of you are my Mum or Dad.\u0001If you make keeping fit more so of a pain,\u0001We will end up obese and lame. \u0000\u0005\u0000\u0000\b\u0000(like you)\u0002\u0002\u0001\u0001Besides:\u0001Those five aside fucking footie fanatics,\u0001For each touch, each goal between the coats and bags – just pedantic,\u0001You accuse me of only my glistening sweat,\u0001But the footie players are the ones, who their seats do wet!\u0001Dem never asked me if this made me puke,\u0001But my mere morning jog, they rebuke.\u0001Democracy is DEAD. Bojo sealed his approval,\u0001His head of a mop and his eyes of ice,\u0001On parliament did he STOMP twice.\u0001SHN – Stay home now! Protect our fantastic NHS!\u0001In your fantasy it lies, you idiot, you clown-punk.\u0001So resign right now and clear your muck,\u0001About your regulations, we don’t give a fuck.\u0001Our life revolves around one CT,\u0001Oh no invalid! Just the T, no C!\u0001Lies, lies, lies, these are all LIES,\u0001But we believe them\u0001Why? For the benefit and satisfaction,\u0001A pointless endeavor.\u0001Of a minuscule fraction! \u0001\u0001","pageStyle":"poem-centre","pageBackground":""}
