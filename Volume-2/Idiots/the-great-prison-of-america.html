    <p>
      Parade and tanks, happiness <br>
      And bullets fly <br>
      "We are keeping them out!" <br>
      "We will make the Mexicans pay!" <br>
      <br>
      Iron bars and concrete pillars <br>
      Shattered glass and rusted <br>
      Cladding. A skyline of dark <br>
      & drab in the smog of the <br>
      Dark, polluted, day! <br>

      "We are leaving the UN!" <br>
      "Leaving the communist, Liberal <br>
      Society. For Capitalism." <br>

      Cranes of stone and white <br>
      Plastic pushes down the <br>
      Final Straw. They wished <br>
      To be. To be America. <br>
      <br>
      They said "America first", <br>
      "Only for America". <br>
      And they got what they <br>
      Wanted. <br>
      <!--TODO: Dual split arrangement for poem. -->
      <br>
      The US anthem blasted, <br>
      It's a painful agony to the Mexicans ... and <br>
      Canadians? <br>
      <br>
      Then they stopped. <br>
      They realised... <br>
      <br>
      As the curtain of steel, <br>
      Cold carbon bonded molecules <br>
      Metallic darkness. <br>
      <br>
      The flag fell! <br>
      <br>
      "Hey, where is the sun?" <br>
      Give us back the <br>
      Sun Mexico! <br>
      Give us back the <br>
      Sky Canada! <br>
      <br>
      They did not <br>
      Forsee the agony <br>
      of a prison their <br>
      country had become, <br>
      Nor when hurdled into space <br>
      And in the orbit of the <br>
      Earth. And they regretted <br> <!--PROPOSAL: The use of the question "Had they regretted...?" may also work here.-->
      what they wanted <br>
      <br>
      <p style="font-size: x-large;">We live in a Society, Where Society<br>Sometimes isn't.</p> <br>
