    <h2 class="centre"> The Great Prison Of America - By Hanash </h2>
    <hr>
    <div class="poem-centre">
    <p>
        Parade and tanks, happiness <br>
        And bullets fly <br>
        "We are keeping them out!" <br>
        "We will make the Mexicans pay!" <br>
        <br>
        Iron bars and concrete pillars <br>
        Shattered glass and rusted <br>
        Cladding. A skyline of dark <br>
        & drab in the smog of the <br>
        Dark, polluted, day! <br>

        "We are leaving the UN!" <br>
        "Leaving the communist, Liberal <br>
        Society. For Capitalism." <br>

        Cranes of stone and white <br>
        Plastic pushes down the <br>
        Final Straw. They wished <br>
        To be. To be America. <br>
        <br>
        They said "America first", <br>
        "Only for America". <br>
        And they got what they <br>
        Wanted. <br>
        <!--TODO: Dual split arrangement for poem. -->
        <br>
        The US anthem blasted, <br>
        It's a painful agony to the Mexicans ... and <br>
        Canadians? <br>
        <br>
        Then they stopped. <br>
        They realised... <br>
        <br>
        As the curtain of steel, <br>
        Cold carbon bonded molecules <br>
        Metallic darkness. <br>
        <br>
        The flag fell! <br>
        <br>
        "Hey, where is the sun?" <br>
        Give us back the <br>
        Sun Mexico! <br>
        Give us back the <br>
        Sky Canada! <br>
        <br>
        They did not <br>
        Forsee the agony <br>
        of a prison their <br>
        country had become, <br>
        Nor when hurdled into space <br>
        And in the orbit of the <br>
        Earth. They regretted <br>
        what they wanted <br>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: x-large;">We live in a Society, Where Society<br>Sometimes isn't.</p> <br>
