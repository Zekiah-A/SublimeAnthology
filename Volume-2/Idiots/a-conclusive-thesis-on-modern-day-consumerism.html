    <p>
        A westener went, up a mountain. <br>
        Up the mountain, in search of a truth. <br>
        A truth turned to a revelation, <br>
        of answers he would not accept, <br>
        his only detriment, <br>
        and this ingrained prejudice grew and bred, <br>
        like that desire for the latest iPhone, must always be so new, <br>
        and his greed for money, a rat in the cycle, <br>
        what an idiot. <br>
        <em>who would've knew?</em> <br>
