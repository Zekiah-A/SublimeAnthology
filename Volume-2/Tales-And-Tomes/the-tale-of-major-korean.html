    <p><i>I once knew a man, a sellsword , traveller, wanderer,<br>
        His name was Major Korean, and now is recounted his tale of woe;<br>
        <br>
        </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was summer of 1923, or whenever it was auf der große streets,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recognised a shadow, that lurked in the corner,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stacks of money, all but useless<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the person I saw, said his name was,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A "Major Korean".<br>
        <br>
        I heard nothing more, until the second great war;<br>
        A rogue soldier, not a nazi in the war,<br>
        Travelled to a land unknown, fought to save many lives<br>
        Grasped only a sword, an iron carved sword,<br>
        Stained with valour, heart of woe.<br>
        The warrior who fought for no country, only to save the others<br>
        Named Major "Korean"<br>
        <br>
        Then I saw, at the door of the gates by the court,<br>
        Tried for crimes, against the law, sat Major Korean,<br>
        Crimes that were not crimes, such as speaking against a dictatorship.<br>
        One of the few people I knew, was Major Korean, who was an<br>
        Anti-racist.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But where is he now, what land does he lie,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A slayer, what became of the man, known as<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major Korean?<br>
        <br>
        This fellow, who was not even Korean, went under that alibi,<br>
        For what, to protect which truths? Hide a life of honour?<br>
        That person who defeated die Leute, tried end racism,<br>
        His fate unknown, Major Korean, the Anti-Racist.<br>
        <br>
        T'was a dark day, when I realised, he had vanished,<br>
        Off the face of the Earth.<br>
        Die Geselschaft, a great enemy, back-stabbed that warrior<br>
        What cave, creek or crevice did he hide, branded as a<br>
        Threat to society?<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I grasped a sword and trained, under the waterfall in the<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dead of the night, stealing my heart to be full of resolve,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To act out justice, restore that myth's honour.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mythical Major Korean.<br>
        <br>
        In those old days, when Stresemann reigned,<br>
        How we'd all think,<br>
        I have Weimar, my republic,<br>
        How I'd want the Kaiser to be King!<br>
        But now, it seems, we were wrong...<br>
        The old days, age of slayers are now far gone.<br>
        Hoonter, Reece, Noct, Major Korean, Speedwagon, Zekiahepic, Barir<br>
        Those times, am besten Zeit<br>
        Die Zukunft war nicht zu toll...<br>
        <br>
        But the tale does not end, no- not the take of Major Korean,<br>
        Borne in 1066, borne of blood, brother in battle to the slayers,<br>
        The un-racist könig.<br>
        War is coming,a great plight, so, he took up th' mantle<br>
        One last time.<br>
        <br>
        A final clash of steel, iron against iron,<br>
        Last march of the catgirl slayers, before stepping into new dawn...<br>
        Major Korean fought valiantly, but comrade after comrade fell,<br>
        Bloodshed blood lets more mo'r blood<br>
        And the ground bleeds red,<br>
        It was then when he said, as the dawn of the next day set;<br>
        Tears in his eyes, tired, could not fight anymore,<br>
        <br>
        I am sorry, Bushi, Noct, Martin Ligations, Swexys, Gundalf,<br>
        Barir, Zekiahepic, Speedwagon, Samurai of the Spear, Dark Juice,<br>
        Juloo, Delta. Solaire, Solar System Man, Reece and all fellow<br>
        Other Slayer;<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order, to defeat this foe, and restore this honour...<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must become racism...<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It must be done, thank you everyone...<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This truly was an adventure, wasn't it?<br>
        <br>
        Then with one final attack, a desperate last resort, a desperate last stand.<br>
        Major Korean unleashed his last attack, his final strike...<br>
        All the enemies were slain, at the cost of Major Korean's sacrifice,<br>
        With a final smile, he faded away, finally at peace, at his end.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>This was the tale of Major Korean.</i><br>
