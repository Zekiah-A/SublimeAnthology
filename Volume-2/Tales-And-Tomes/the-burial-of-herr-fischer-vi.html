    <p>
        Die Gesundheit hath toll,<br>
        As the bloody bell strikes 9,<br>
        It's a systematic tall, evenly spaced,<br>
        Each ring, marking th' upcoming hour of death,<br>
        "Here lies Herr Fischer VI"<br>
        What a man you are,<br>
        <br>
        Stratified crowds gather, people clumping,<br>
        By matter of thought, how to make it appear,<br>
        To be, fair, but of bias,<br>
        Randomness creates a chaos,<br>
        Entropy crackles in the air...<br>
        <br>
        Again the bloody bell tolls, now it is midnight.<br>
        Mitternacht, the dead cry,<br>
        As the city turns silent, it's empty cities weep silently,<br>
        At this newfound threat,<br>
        All lies silent, a part from the forest path,<br>
        That leads into that dense undergrowth,<br>
        <br>
        Few words remained in these lands,<br>
        The mines had long fell silent, emitting a dull bloody glow.<br>
        A crimson sky revealed itself overhead, only those of the<br>
        Forest dared walk, among those twigs, red in hue,<br>
        Bones and skulls of dead beasts,<br>
        <br>
        But back at the capital, as again the dock whirs,<br>
        The streets awaken in fear, met by the blighted hearse,<br>
        Through interlocking valleys of architecture, menaced in design,<br>
        And through the bloody views of the streets,<br>
        Atop that carnage was a man, clad in feather,<br>
        Deathly plague-doctor<br>
        And he said to me:<br>
        <i><br>
        "It's a descendant of the late lineage of Fischer,<br>
        The infamous family, yet I scorn my kind, and<br>
        Weep for the students at the academy.<br>
        I storm them all, sane my liege, who I bear,<br>
        From the merciless upper-course down to the gentle but deep,<br>
        Lands of the low, I have carried this hearse,<br>
        A coffin bearer, for seven days yet,<br>
        My journey plotted in the bag of blood running up my spine,<br>
        Continuous was the toil, yet the event of this day,<br>
        If I may say so discretely,<br>
        It be a terrible day f√ºr die Geselschaft,<br>
        For now will I bury Herr Fischer VI,<br>
        The only honourable of his line, though bred from menaces,<br>
        He fought to free the scholars of Tibbet from their unending curse,<br>
        </i>Now again, I recount, as this bloody moon low-lies,<br>
        I am a bearer of a curse.<br>
        The curse to think of the crimes of the Fischers, evermore,<br>
        Despite this fellow, blighted by the plague,<br>
        As I, indeed am one infected.<br>
        Now nam'd the doctor of physique,<br>
        A plague doctor, who wanders these harmed streets,<br>
        Now peace, I say to you, and I bid you well".<br>
        <br>
        The doctor was ne'er seen again,<br>
        As the dawn approached.<br>
        Another day, another folk.<br>
        This was the tale of Herr Fischer VI,<br>
        In this torn, where he was carried, already dead<br>
        This torn, pained in it's bloody coat.<br>
        <br>
