    <p>
        Sometimes I just wish I were a spider, <br>
        legs sprawled, against a wall, <br>
        or a small crevice, <br>
        a calm place that I could tuck into, when it is cold. <br>
        <br>
        Consumerism would lay dead for me. <br>
        Hand crafting a piece of art, so easily blown away by the wind, <br>
        like some kind of monk, carefully laying out each grain, only for one hand to destroy the other's creation. <br>
        But I'd have no skill. <br>
        It would all come naturally, instinctively, like  the mind of an artist, or the adventurism of a calligrapher, who spends days weaving, turning and linking the islands of this oh-so lost world. <br>
        Yet i have none of these, now. <br>
        <br>
        Imagine a world without time; <br>
        no clocks, no calendars, no dials. <br>
        Yet this is how the spiders live, <br>
        their only clock; night and day, <br>
        their only calendar; the seasons, <br>
        and their only dials, being the ageing, as the years pass on, bringing new spiders onto this earth. <br>
        Spiders are never late, spiders are never early. <br>
        They live in the moment, waiting for the next one, yet satisfied with what they have right now. <br>
        <br>
        And it's amazing, <br>
        how humans innovate, create. <br>
        Yet spiders have no drive to push further, <br>
        no need to go to the extends of space, or venture the depths of the ocean. <br>
        But for spiders? <br>
        Nothing. Ever. Changes. <br>
        And is it better that way? <br>
        As spiders don't need qualifications, certifications, or legislations just to be classed as functioning. <br>
        They have no need to fit into the jigsaw; of office or labour work, <br>
        led to make decisions in days, weeks, seconds,  <br>
        that could change the rest of a life. <br>
        <br>
        And it's like that beauty of time, <br>
        the grace of each gold-crusted cog on a clock that turns so intricately, <br>
        the heavens and our stars, and the round moon that comes full every so often, <br>
        is our greatest antagoniser. <br>
        <br>
        As we decide on things so crucial so fast, <br>
        a wrong one causing so much suffering in the end, <br>
        and a right one causing the same; except just for someone else. <br>
        Since the world was never truly free, it's all binary. <br>
        And would one feel any better, knowing that he was free, and the <br>
        reason that he did nothing to change the world in life, lest the  <br>
        grass that he stepped on, or the webs that he unknowingly <br>
        destroyed, was not the fault of the world, but was entirely his na√Øve decisions? <br>
        Or would false hope be greater under a regime without choice; at <br>
        least knowing that while not contributing alone to humanity, he was <br> 
        part of a grand clockwork, pushing his country further for future generations? <br>
        <br>
        It seems like the world decided that we should all be alone, when <br>
        pursuing our dreams, or just trying to make it better for our descendants. <br>
        <br>
        And while the 'unfree', democratically enact their power to <br>
        disagree, and break away from the crowd. <br>
        <br>
        Spiders disagree too. <br>
        As while millions all descend from the same womb. <br>
        Spiders live alone, apart, and make a difference alone, <br>
        coating the walls in fresh sets of silk, and invisibly clearing the pests of our lives. <br>
        Yet somehow they have no human nature; no feelings of failure when their webs are destroyed, and their legacy blown full. <br>
        <br>
        And still, the primitive humans can't shake the feeling that they have failed, unless they cure world hunger, war or some other stupid thing they made. <br>
        <br>
        And maybe that's why so many people fear them? <br>
        <br>
        And now I wonder; <br>
        do the spiders even know of the millennia of ancestors that came before them? <br>
        Or the magic of their web. <br>
        Or the wonders of the sublime things that brought them in existence? <br>
        Or are they just living? <br>
        <em>In the moment.</em>
