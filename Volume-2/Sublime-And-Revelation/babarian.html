        Nobody wins on the first spin, <br>
        It usually goes round, <br>
        and later falls down, gravity does that, <br>
        but what about the kid's frown, <br>
        well it all started on a cold wet break, <br>
        'twas a mistake to partake in <br>
        this game. <br>
        Diablo. <br>
        <br>
        Old fashioned wooden ones, dual <br>
        ball bearings, light-up rubber, <br>
        plastic ones, all the cool kids <br>
        glaring. Tension builds in the <br>
        year 5 playground, who can do <br>
        the most flips? Who can do the <br>
        most tricks? Accumulating scratches, <br>
        exhilirating. <br>
        <br>
        Thrown up into the air, catching <br>
        it on one stick, until it hits <br>
        the wet gravel floor, <br>
        fun in something so basic. <br>
        <br>
        Muscle memory ingrained for life, <br>
        recovered from the closet. <br>
        I remember competitions only concluded by <br>
        the scream of the whistle. Yet I <br>
        am rusty now. <br>
        Oh what fun we had on the year 5 playground. <br>
