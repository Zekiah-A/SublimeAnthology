The sky dull blue, grey <br>\nblending into the horizon, the wind slow, cold, <br>\nthe breeze of the sea. <br>\n<br>\nAs I trodded on through the graves, <br>\nhunched, a small shape emerged from <br>\nthe dust. Polished sandy straps of <br>\nsome sort of metal. Cogs exposed through <br>\nsand-stained glass. <br>\n<br>\nAnd like a gem, oh how it stood out. <br>\nPreserved like some creature within epoxy <br>\nresin. Polished like the marbles in a great <br>\nfather's pouch, letting light <br>\nthrough, as each hand casts a gentle shadow. <br>\n<br>\nAnd I wondered, at this cold clockwork <br>\ncogs-a-spinning, intricate dials <br>\nthis had to be created, by someone, <br>\nas it shines the sun's light in a <br>\ndull world, it's complexity, in a <br>\nvoid of nothing, and pressed on these things, <br>\nthe creator's passions read \"Wine  <br>\nInc. Watches\" - And starving it reminded <br>\nme of bread; I misread. <br>\n<br>\nFor I realised I was a sinner, denier of the <br>\nlast dinner. For the world was zounds bigger <br>\nand more complex than these. 5,000 of <br>\nthese watches, polished and clean <br>\nprobably hide here waiting to <br>\nbe seen, and the planets and the <br>\nstars and the cities and the trees. <br>\nWho had the ambition to make <br>\nall of these? <br>\n<br>\nI believe, <br>\nIn the Sublime. <br>\n<br>","pageStyle":"poem-centre-wide","pageBackground":""}
