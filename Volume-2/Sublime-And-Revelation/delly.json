The sky dull blue, grey \u0001blending into the horizon, the wind slow, cold, \u0001the breeze of the sea. \u0001\u0001As I trodded on through the graves, \u0001hunched, a small shape emerged from \u0001the dust. Polished sandy straps of \u0001some sort of metal. Cogs exposed through \u0001sand-stained glass. \u0001\u0001And like a gem, oh how it stood out. \u0001Preserved like some creature within epoxy \u0001resin. Polished like the marbles in a great \u0001father's pouch, letting light \u0001through, as each hand casts a gentle shadow. \u0001\u0001And I wondered, at this cold clockwork \u0001cogs-a-spinning, intricate dials \u0001this had to be created, by someone, \u0001as it shines the sun's light in a \u0001dull world, it's complexity, in a \u0001void of nothing, and pressed on these things, \u0001the creator's passions read \"Wine  \u0001Inc. Watches\" - And starving it reminded \u0001me of bread; I misread. \u0001\u0001For I realised I was a sinner, denier of the \u0001last dinner. For the world was zounds bigger \u0001and more complex than these. 5,000 of \u0001these watches, polished and clean \u0001probably hide here waiting to \u0001be seen, and the planets and the \u0001stars and the cities and the trees. \u0001Who had the ambition to make \u0001all of these? \u0001\u0001I believe, \u0001In the Sublime. \u0001\u0001","pageStyle":"poem-centre-wide","pageBackground":""}
