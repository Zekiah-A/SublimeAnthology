        Green lines of ink, run down these walls, <br>
        Inscribed with tales of tesselation. <br>
        Yet I can't quite remember these days, <br>
        months, weeks. <br>
        <br>
        I spent with those phreaks, <br>
        crazy for chess, endless war scourge. <br>
        Chip batty stained jeans, curry stained tops. <br>
        Stalemate, check, all that I heard. <br>
        <br>
        It's absurd. <br>
        <br>
        My resting state of general peace has been disrupted <br>
        by memories, <br>
        of war, an incomprehensable force, <br>
        my mind flares up with the harrowing thoughts of black <br>
        after white, white after black, <br>
        changing my mind, changing it back, <br>
        castling down, now king is in check, <br>
        battlefield agony, pawns are in wrech. <br>
        <br>
        The small guys are expendable, <br>
        black's last and queen's fast, <br>
        is all that I remember, all that I learned. <br>
        <br>
        From Chess in M2. <br>
        Flip the board. I'm beserk. <br>
