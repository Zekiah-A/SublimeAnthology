    <p>
        I was walking in a desert, with a deserted map, <br>
        in an empty space. <br>
        No day, no night, no moon, just walking, <br>
        just walking to find a purpose. <br>
        <br>
        Then one day, on some same salt plain, <br>
        a bloody sand licked tissue, as far <br>
        as I could see. The sky dull blue, grey <br>
        blending into the horizon, the wind slow, cold, <br>
        the breeze of the sea. <br>
        <br>
        As I trodded on through the graves, <br>
        hunched, a small shape emerged from <br>
        the dust. Polished sandy straps of <br>
        some sort of metal. Cogs exposed through <br>
        sand-stained glass. <br>
        <br>
        And like a gem, oh how it stood out. <br>
        Preserved like some creature within epoxy <br>
        resin. Polished like the marbles in a great <br>
        father's pouch, letting light <br>
        through, as each hand casts a gentle shadow. <br>
        <br>
        And I wondered, at this cold clockwork <br>
        cogs-a-spinning, intricate dials <br>
        this had to be created, by someone, <br>
        as it shines the sun's light in a <br>
        dull world, it's complexity, in a <br>
        void of nothing, and pressed on these things, <br>
        the creator's passions read "Wine  <br>
        Inc. Watches" - And starving it reminded <br>
        me of bread; I misread. <br>
        <br>
        For I realised I was a sinner, denier of the <br>
        last dinner. For the world was zounds bigger <br>
        and more complex than these. 5,000 of <br>
        these watches, polished and clean <br>
        probably hide here waiting to <br>
        be seen, and the planets and the <br>
        stars and the cities and the trees. <br>
        Who had the ambition to make <br>
        all of these? <br>
        <br>
        I believe, <br>
        In the Sublime. <br>
