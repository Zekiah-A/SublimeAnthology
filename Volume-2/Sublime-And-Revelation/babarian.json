Tension builds in the <br>\nyear 5 playground, who can do <br>\nthe most flips? Who can do the <br>\nmost tricks? Accumulating scratches, <br>\nexhilirating. <br>\n<br>\nThrown up into the air, catching <br>\nit on one stick, until it hits <br>\nthe wet gravel floor, <br>\nfun in something so basic. <br>\n<br>\nMuscle memory ingrained for life, <br>\nrecovered from the closet. <br>\nI remember competitions only concluded by <br>\nthe scream of the whistle. Yet I <br>\nam rusty now. <br>\nOh what fun we had on the year 5 playground. <br>\n<br>","pageStyle":"centre","pageBackground":""}
